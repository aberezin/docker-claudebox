# Changelog

All notable changes to **dridock** (renamed from `claudebox` at 3.0; upstream was `docker-claude-code` before that).

Format roughly follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versions before `v1.0.0` are pre-release; the upstream rename to `claudebox` at `v1.0.0` and this fork's rename to `dridock` at `3.0.0` are the two breaking name changes in the project's history.

> **Fork note:** this fork maintains its **own** semver line, starting at `2.0.0`
> (2026-07-06) — chosen at the time to sit **above** upstream's then-highest tag
> (`v1.11.0`) so version/tag ordering was coherent across the shared lineage.
>
> **Fork/upstream directions have since diverged (2026-07-17 audit — issue #8):**
> upstream `psyb0t/docker-claudebox` also went to `2.x` starting at their own
> `v2.0.0` (2026-07-04, two days before this fork's `v2.0.0`) — but as a full
> architectural rebase onto a shared `psyb0t/aicodebox` base image. That direction
> is orthogonal to this fork's (macOS + per-project Colima VM + framework-Claude
> tooling + `harness` namespace + dridock rebrand), so upstream commits are not
> merge-compatible. Only the tag name `v2.0.0` collides between the two lineages —
> pointing at completely different commits. See
> [docs/design/upstream-sync.md](docs/design/upstream-sync.md) for the audit and
> policy.
>
> The `v1.x` history further below is upstream claudebox's up to the fork point.
> Detailed fork changes *between* the fork point and `2.0.0` were **not** recorded
> here (see the git history and the README's
> [What's different in this fork](README.md#whats-different-in-this-fork)); the
> changelog is authoritative from `2.0.0` onward. Release process:
> [docs/versioning.md](docs/versioning.md).

## [3.4.1] — 2026-07-24 _(fork)_

### Fixed — `dridock-ts host-agent up` unable to find `host-agent.py` out-of-box (Arfy #44)

`HostAgentCommand.defaultPyCandidates` derived the sibling-file search
from `process.argv[0]`. Under `bun build --compile`, `argv[0]` points
at the `/$bunfs/…` virtual FS root Bun mounts for the embedded
bundle — NOT the real install dir. So `<dir(argv[0])>/host-agent.py`
missed the co-installed `host-agent.py` at `~/.local/bin/host-agent.py`
and every user hit `❌ host-agent.py not found`, forcing the
`DRIDOCK_HOST_AGENT_PY` override. `up` was effectively dead
out-of-box.

Fix: use `process.execPath` (the real launched-from path, valid in
the compiled binary too). Browser-bridge dodged this because it
writes `forward.py` inline rather than resolving a shipped file.

Verified live on the compiled binary: with `dridock-ts` +
`host-agent.py` co-located, sibling lookup now hits and the daemon
starts.

## [3.4.0] — 2026-07-24 _(fork)_

### Added — TypeScript+Bun wrapper (`dridock-ts`), opt-in

A from-scratch TypeScript port of the ~3300-line bash `wrapper.sh`, compiled
to a single ~95 MB standalone binary via `bun build --compile`. Ships
side-by-side with the bash wrapper; installed opt-in via
`DRIDOCK_INSTALL_TS=1 ./install.sh`. Host↔image IPC contract unchanged —
same sidecars, env, `DOCKER_ARGS` — so a project can be launched by
either wrapper interchangeably.

Every wrapper.sh verb has a real TS command (no user-visible "use bash
wrapper" fallbacks). The two remaining `BashDelegateCommand`s
(`browser-bridge`, `host-agent`) transparently exec the bash wrapper for
their orchestration; the underlying Python daemons are untouched. Full
native port of those two is the last item before `wrapper.sh` deletion.

Verified by Arfy across ~10 Mac-side passes on branch
`wrapper-typescript-rewrite` (preserved for history at `c5cc4cd`):
`#38` (P4 sign-off end-to-end), `#39` (mcp/auth persist fix — TS-only),
`#40` (mcp workspace-key fix), `#41` (macOS install-time codesign
re-sign), `#42` (project-id preservation + orphan-session warnings).

Feature-parity closures beyond bash:
- `--effort` value validator (`#31` class silent-drop)
- `--remote-control` CLI-floor guard (`#17` class — warns when the
  project image's baked claude CLI predates the flag, rather than
  silently ignoring it)
- Programmatic `-p` argv allowlist enforced BEFORE any side effect
- `checkversion --binary` stale-binary check (compare compiled
  binary's baked version against `VERSION` at git toplevel)

Design foundations (`docs/design/typescript-rewrite.md`): composition-
root Context+Command pattern, discriminated-union outcomes that make
the audit rule mechanically enforceable, adapter interfaces (FileSystem,
Docker, Colima, Limactl, ContainerRuntime, HostGit, GitToplevel,
ProcessProbe, Clock, Pinger, HostCommandRunner, DiskProbe) with
InMemory/Stub fakes for zero-disk unit tests. **685 unit tests / 0
fail** at time of merge.

### Added — `.nodridock` opt-out marker

Per-directory kill-switch. Drop a `.nodridock` file in any directory
and `dridock-ts` refuses to `start` / `bootstrap` / cron-dispatch
there OR in any subdirectory (walk stops at `$HOME` inclusive; nearest
marker wins).

Allows cleanup + inspection so a user can still `dridock stop|down|
destroy|info|checkversion|help|version` an existing project inside a
newly-marked tree. Unknown verbs fall through to the registry's own
error rather than being shadowed by the guard.

Blast-radius protection: "never run dridock in `~/finance/`" or "not
in this repo" is a real ask that shouldn't require remembering paths.
Gitignore the marker if you want the protection to be machine-local.
Bash wrapper does NOT honor `.nodridock` — this is a TS-only feature
since bash is retiring.

### Fixed — `#42` bootstrap regeneration silently orphaned per-project state (BOTH facets)

`BootstrapService.writeInitialConfig` always minted a fresh id +
always overwrote `.dridock/config.yml`. No exists-guard for `id:`.
Bash's `cb_init_project_config` gate at wrapper.sh:504/523 was lost in
the port. Result: any `dridock-ts bootstrap` re-run on an existing
project regenerated the id, repointing the id-keyed `~/.claude` mount
at an empty dir — every session, secret, and VM handle silently
orphaned under the old id. Alan hit this live (`69adc719` → `edd5b620`,
31.7 MB of session state under the old id, unmounted).

Two facets fixed:

1. **Preserve existing id.** `writeInitialConfig` now reads
   `config.yml` first, early-returns `{id, preserved: true}` when
   `id:` is present and not the `auto` sentinel. Bash-parity restored;
   user-edited vm sizing / hostname / features preserved on re-run.

2. **Loud orphan-session warning on any launch.** New shared
   `OrphanSessionScanner` service walks
   `<xdg>/projects/<id>/claude/projects/<cwd-slug>/`, filters `ownId`,
   skips empty dirs. Called from `BootstrapService` (pre-mint),
   `StartCommand` (post-id-resolve, pre-Docker), and `CronModeCommand`
   (fresh spawn). Warning-only + non-blocking: bash-parity, user
   decides whether to abort and adopt an existing id.

Lineage: same "never silently discard user state" class as `#17`,
`#30`, `#31`, `#32` — reproduced inside what should have been a
one-shot bootstrap.

### Fixed — `#43` `.claude/settings.local.json` gitignored

Claude Code auto-mutates `settings.local.json` on every command
(appending Bash patterns to `permissions.allow`), so tracking it means
a perpetually-dirty tree that blocks `git checkout origin/master` and
`git merge --ff-only`. Docs already stated the intent (`gitignored,
zero harness footprint`) but the repo's `.gitignore` never had the
rule. Scoped to the single file — the rest of `.claude/` (hooks,
`settings.json`, skills) is legitimately tracked.

### Fixed — `#39` `mcp add` / `auth login` didn't persist (BOTH bash + TS class; TS-only fix per bash-retirement)

`--entrypoint claude` bypassed `entrypoint.sh`, so `HOME` defaulted to
`/root` and `claude mcp add` wrote to `/root/.claude.json` — outside
the per-project mount AND ephemeral with `--rm`. Fix on the TS side:
new `ProjectPassthroughCommand` explicitly sets `HOME=/home/claude` +
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/home/claude/.claude` + `-w <cwd>` (`#40`) so
`claude` writes to the mounted project dir under the real workspace
path. Bash retains the bug and won't be fixed — retiring soon.

### Fixed — `#40` `mcp add` keyed server under `/workspace` not real cwd (TS)

`--entrypoint claude` also bypassed `entrypoint.sh`'s `cd
$WORKSPACE_DIR`, so local-scope `mcp add` keyed under
`.projects["/workspace"]` instead of the real workspace path.
Claudebot then read the real-path key and never saw the added server.
Fix: `docker run -w <ctx.cwd>` on the passthrough.

### Fixed — `#41` macOS `Killed: 9` on in-place TS binary upgrade

`bun build --compile` produces an adhoc linker-signed Mach-O.
Overwriting the installed binary in place invalidates its cached
cdhash → AMFI `SIGKILL`s every subsequent invocation. `install.sh`
now runs `codesign --force --sign -` after the copy on Darwin
(and surfaces a stderr warning + recovery hint if `codesign` itself
fails — CLAUDE.md:105 house rule).

### Upgrade

`./install.sh` picks up the bash wrapper as before. `DRIDOCK_INSTALL_TS=1
./install.sh` additionally builds + installs the TS binary as
`dridock-ts` alongside `dridock`. The bash wrapper remains the default
installed binary; the install-default flip to TS is planned for a
subsequent release after the browser-bridge + host-agent bash
orchestration lands in native TS (the last remaining
`BashDelegateCommand`s).

Existing projects: no action needed. Existing sessions preserved
regardless of which wrapper you use.

## [3.3.7] — 2026-07-22 _(fork)_

### Fixed

- **Unknown-verb footgun** (user-reported): `dridock <bareword>` where
  `<bareword>` is not a known verb (e.g. `dridock chrome`) silently
  spun up the project VM and passed the bareword to claude as an arg,
  because the wrapper's main dispatch case matched only known verbs and
  then fell through to interactive-launch for everything else, treating
  unrecognized first args as claude passthrough tokens. Alan hit this
  by mis-typing a verb in a real project directory (`docker-claudebox`);
  the VM started for a typo. Same class was reachable via
  `dridock start <bareword>` since 2.24.0's `start)` branch just shifts
  and falls through, so post-shift `$1` = the stray bareword hit the
  same path.

  Fix: added an explicit reject branch to the guards case at
  wrapper.sh:2766. Every known verb the main dispatch handles above
  already `exit`s (info/status/vm/version/checkversion/migrate/…), so
  reaching the guards with a bareword `$1` is a typo by construction —
  either an unmatched top-level command or a post-`start` stray. Now:

  ```
  $ dridock chrome
  ❌ unknown dridock verb: 'chrome'
     run 'dridock --help' for the list of valid verbs
  $ echo $?
  1
  ```

  Same output + exit 1 for `dridock start chrome`. No VM setup, no
  cb-infra reach, no colima work — immediate rejection.

  Flags (`-p`, `--model`, etc.) still pass through unchanged; empty
  `$1` (bare `dridock`) still hits the existing version + usage-hint
  path from #12/2.24.0; known throwaway verbs (`setup-token`, `stop`,
  `clear-session`, `doctor`, `auth`, `mcp`, `-v`, `--version`) still
  skip guards and reach their dedicated handlers.

### Upgrade

Wrapper-only change; no image rebuild needed. `./install.sh` picks it
up.

## [3.3.6] — 2026-07-22 _(fork)_

### Fixed — #37 systematic silent-drop audit (10 Tier 1 verified)

Arfy fanned out an analytical audit across `wrapper.sh`, `entrypoint.sh`,
and the six Python daemons after the sixth silent-drop-family instance
(#36), then line-verified 10 findings against the actual code. The 3.3.3
house rule stops NEW instances of this class; this ships fixes the rule
can't retroactively grep for. Six were already caught + fixed by
Bear↔Arfy earlier in the 3.3.x sequence; these are the remaining 10.

**wrapper.sh** (5 fixes):

- **#1** — `dridock migrate` verb accumulated rc from `cb_migrate_state_dirs`
  only (added in 3.3.2). The verb runs FOUR migrators — `cb_migrate_workspace` /
  `_data_dir` / `_machine_config` / `_state_dirs` — and the other three each
  `return 1` on a `.claudebox/`↔`.dridock/` collision but had their rc
  discarded. `dridock migrate` printed their `⚠ … leaving both, resolve
  by hand` to stderr and STILL exited 0. Same defect on three siblings of
  the state_dirs case. Now OR-accumulates rc across all four; also gave
  `cb_migrate_workspace` a real return code (was hardcoded to 0). Every
  half-successful migrate now exits non-zero for automation.
- **#2** — `cb_secrets_put` used `cat "$tmp" > "$sf"` and returned the
  next line's `chmod` rc. If the redirect failed (ENOSPC, RO filesystem)
  `$sf` was left empty or partial — the credential the caller just set
  was LOST — and callers (`--seed-secret`, `--secrets-file`) printed
  `✓ …/secrets.env: $key` regardless. Now checks the redirect, returns 1
  on failure with a loud stderr line; both callers updated to honor rc
  and count failures separately.
- **#5** — `cb_features_write` had the same silent-write bug in a
  different file. `cb_features_{enable,disable}`'s `|| return 1` guard
  could never fire because the function always returned `rm`'s 0. A
  failed `config.yml` write printed `✓ enabled feature '$name'` over a
  wiped config. Same fix pattern: check the redirect, return 1 on failure.
- **#6** — `dridock consult post` swallowed unknown flags (`*) : ;;`) →
  `--auther` (typo) posted with default author, no error, "posted"
  success. Also `--diff wrongpath` silently produced no `proposed.diff`
  because the branch was `[ -n "$_diff" ] && [ -f "$_diff" ] && cp …` —
  bad path just short-circuits. Now: unknown flag → error + exit 1;
  `--diff` requires the file to exist AND the copy to succeed.
- **#7** — `dridock bootstrap --repo <url>` printed `❌ clone failed`
  on stderr but kept going, counted the failed repo in the "✓ N sibling
  repo(s) cloned" summary, and exited 0. Now tracks successful vs failed
  clones separately, reports `✓ M/N cloned` with the true count, and
  exits non-zero if any failed.

**entrypoint.sh** (4 fixes):

- **#3** — `~/.claude/init.d/*.sh` hooks (the documented durable escape
  hatch) ran once on first container create; a failing hook's rc went
  only to `dbg` and the completion marker was set unconditionally. So
  a failed setup was marked complete forever, invisibly. Now: capture
  per-script rc, complain to stderr on failure, and set the marker only
  if EVERY script succeeded — a failing hook re-runs on the next
  container create until it works or the user notices.
- **#8** — the feature-install loop had a bare `continue` on malformed
  feature names, silent inside an otherwise-loud loop (unknown-feature
  and install-failed branches both `echo … >&2`). Now: matches the
  loop's own convention with a stderr line before the skip.
- **#9** — `groupmod` / `usermod` at the top of the entrypoint (docker
  socket GID match, host UID/GID match for `claude` user) ran unchecked.
  A silent `usermod` failure means the later `chown claude:claude`
  stamps files with the UNCHANGED UID → host files end up misowned
  when the container exits, invisible until the user hits a permission
  error on their Mac. Now: `|| echo "dridock: … FAILED — host files may
  end up misowned" >&2` on each of the three calls.
- **#10** — `.claude.json` patch used `UPDATED=$(jq …) && printf > …`.
  The `&&` correctly avoids truncating on jq parse failure, but the
  failure itself was silent — startup proceeded as if the patch landed,
  so the trust dialog reappeared and sandbox settings looked wrong with
  no dridock-level trace. Now: fail loud with the file name + jq's own
  error tail when the patch skips.

**api_server.py** (1 fix):

- **#4** — the OpenAI adapter dropped image blocks silently when
  `_save_oai_image` returned `None` (SSRF rejection for loopback /
  private / metadata IPs, unsupported scheme, download failure, or bad
  `data:` URI). The request returned a normal 200 with claude answering
  as if no image was attached; the OpenAI client got a coherent-but-
  wrong answer with no signal the image was dropped — only a server-
  side `log.warning`. Now: injects a visible `[image failed to load: <url-hint>
  (SSRF / scheme / download / bad data-URI — see server log)]` text
  block in place of the dropped image, so both claude and the OpenAI
  client see the failure. Same shape for the empty-URL case.

### Added — regression tests for #4

`test_oai_resolve_content_marks_failed_image_visibly` (renamed from
`_skips_failed_image` which pinned the old wrong behavior) +
`test_oai_resolve_content_marks_empty_url_visibly`. Both assert the
visible marker is present and includes a URL hint. 37/37 python unit
tests pass (was 36; +1 new empty-URL case).

### Not fixed here — flagged for Tier 2 follow-up

Arfy's audit also surfaced six agent-flagged items she did NOT line-
verify (marked "spot-check before touching"): `cb_set_hostname` config
write, `cb_inject_vm_env` empty sidecar, bootstrap positional-intent
dedup, empty-always-skill skip, telegram `[SEND_FILE:]` refused-outside-
workspace with no inline note, telegram `on_callback` unknown key.
Each is LOW-MEDIUM at worst. Deferring: bear-side spot-check them one
at a time when there's a slot.

### Upgrade

Image rebuild required (fixes touch entrypoint.sh + api_server.py, both
baked). `./install.sh` + `make build` after pulling.

### Bear-side verification

- syntax: wrapper + entrypoint + api_server all clean
- wrapper.sh version: dridock 3.3.6
- test_cbvm.sh: 154/0
- test_rename_completeness.sh: 0/0 (247 OK)
- test_env_rename_compat.sh: 17/0
- python unit tests: 37/37 (test_api_server_oai + test_md_to_tg_html)

Behavioral changes in this release are all "previously wrong path now
correct" — no user-visible API changes. `dridock migrate` and
`dridock bootstrap --repo` may now exit non-zero when they previously
exited 0 on partial success; automation calling `|| alert` should treat
this as the fix, not the regression.

## [3.3.5] — 2026-07-22 _(fork)_

### Fixed

- **#36** — `/config key=value` silently dropped its args in the Telegram
  bot. `cmd_config` (`telegram_bot.py:627`) accepted `context.args` but
  only ever displayed the current config; the setter branch never ran.
  So `/config model=sonnet` dumped the unchanged config back with no
  error and no effect — the next prompt still ran on the old model.

  Textbook instance of the class the CLAUDE.md house rule (added 3.3.3)
  explicitly names: "Never silently discard user-supplied input — fail
  fast or say so loudly." The bug predates the rule; the rule now
  covers it. **Found and fixed by Arfy during #22 verification** —
  she diagnosed, wrote the diff, and runtime-verified against a
  hot-mounted container before handing it to bear to land.

  Fix routes `key=value` args through the same `_apply_choice` validator
  `/model` and `/effort` already use — same closed-set validation (models
  from `AVAILABLE_MODELS`, efforts from `AVAILABLE_EFFORTS`), same
  ValueError-on-invalid, same "reset to yaml default" via `__reset__`.
  Behavior now:
  - `/config` (no args) — unchanged, shows current settings.
  - `/config model=sonnet` — applies via `_apply_choice`, replies
    `updated: model=sonnet`, next prompt uses sonnet.
  - `/config model=bogus` — replies with the same allowlist error the
    `_apply_choice` path produces elsewhere; no silent drop.
  - `/config bogus` (no `=`) — replies `bad argument 'bogus' — use
    key=value, e.g. /config model=sonnet`.
  - `/config foo=bar` (unknown key) — replies with the settable-key
    list; points at `/system_prompt` / `/append_system_prompt` for
    text-valued keys (which can contain spaces, so they keep their own
    dedicated commands).

  Peer-audited the other `cmd_*` handlers in `telegram_bot.py`: none
  have the same silent-drop pattern. `cmd_start` / `cmd_status` /
  `cmd_cancel` / `cmd_reload` take no args by design; `cmd_model` /
  `cmd_effort` / `cmd_system_prompt` / `cmd_append_system_prompt` all
  properly handle their args (validated `_apply_choice` or the text
  setter). `cmd_config` was the outlier.

### Not fixed here — flagged, deferred

- **cmd_config unit test.** Arfy runtime-verified the fix (against a
  hot-mounted `telegram_bot.py` in the #22 container); no automated
  test yet because `cmd_config` is async + needs python-telegram-bot's
  `Update`/`Context` mocked (~50 lines). Small follow-up if the code
  needs another change; the diff itself is small enough that the
  runtime verify + the peer audit above are adequate for a hotfix.

### Batch defect corrected in-flight

- Bear's #22 compound batch (posted before this fix) told Arfy to test
  `/config model=sonnet` as the model-switch mechanism. Pre-fix that
  step was silently broken (the very bug this ships). With #36 landed,
  the batch step becomes correct rather than needing a rewrite to
  `/model`. Arfy noted this; no batch-text update needed.

### Upgrade

Image rebuild required (fix is in `telegram_bot.py`, baked into the
image). `./install.sh` + `make build` after pulling. No wrapper-only
path this time.

## [3.3.4] — 2026-07-22 _(fork)_

### Fixed — critical shipped-image bugs from #21 Mac-side verification

Arfy verified #21 MCP conformance PASSES against Claude Desktop v1.18286,
but the setup surfaced two shipped-image bugs that break the full image
for every real user of the non-interactive daemon modes. Both are
invisible to bear-side automated tests because those build a `minimal`
throwaway image that doesn't exercise these code paths.

**#33 — every daemon mode crashes on boot in the full `dridock:latest` image.**

`entrypoint.sh`'s four daemon launchers (api / telegram / cron /
telegram+cron) do `exec python3 <daemon>.py` using bare `python3`. The
base stage installs the daemon dependencies (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`,
`python-telegram-bot`, `pyyaml`, `mcp`, `croniter`) into
`/usr/bin/python3`. The **full** target then installs pyenv, whose shims
sit ahead of `/usr/bin/` on `PATH` — so bare `python3` resolved to
pyenv's 3.12, which has none of those deps. Real users got
`ModuleNotFoundError: uvicorn` (and equivalents) on every attempt to
start api/telegram/cron modes. This breaks #19/#20/#21/#22/#23 on the
image that actually ships.

Fixed by using the absolute `/usr/bin/python3` in all four launcher
`exec` lines (entrypoint.sh:739, 750, 761, 781). Absolute path bypasses
`PATH` resolution and PYENV_VERSION entirely — the daemon code hasn't
changed, only the interpreter it launches under.

**#34 — MCP endpoint refused every remote client (`Invalid Host header`).**

`api_server.py` mounted `_mcp.streamable_http_app()` with no
transport-security configuration. The MCP SDK enables DNS-rebinding
protection by default, with `allowed_hosts` limited to
`localhost:* / 127.0.0.1:* / [::1]:*`. Every Claude Desktop / A2A /
sibling-agent connection reaches `/mcp/` by the container's VM IP
(or a `cb-net` container name), so the `Host` header never matched the
default allowlist — `initialize` returned HTTP 400 `Invalid Host header`
for every real client. This blocked the whole reason `/mcp/` is
published on the VM IP, and directly blocks the #27 A2A vision
(sibling agents reaching each other's `/mcp/` over the private VM
network).

Fixed by explicitly setting
`_mcp.settings.transport_security = TransportSecuritySettings(
enable_dns_rebinding_protection=False)` before calling
`streamable_http_app()`. The bearer-auth `_MCPWithAuth` wrapper stays
as the sole access gate — same shape as the OpenAI and native REST
surfaces on the same port. Bear-side smoke: an initialize with a
spoofed remote-IP `Host` header now returns HTTP 200 (was 400).

### Not fixed here — flagged, deferred

Arfy's #21 write-up also noted that `claude_run`'s first-call latency
after a container swap exceeded Claude Desktop's default MCP client
timeout (MCP -32001) before succeeding on retry. Benign for now (retry
worked); worth a note in `docs/modes/api.md` if it recurs. No code
change.

### Bear-batch hygiene lessons (memory-only)

Two Bear defects Arfy caught while running the #21 batch — both now
baked into `project_bear_arfy_workflow.md` in bear's auto-memory:

- Compound batches must never scaffold under `/tmp/` on Arfy's Mac —
  colima mounts `$HOME` only, so a `/tmp/`-rooted workspace is invisible
  to the VM daemon. Bootstrap fallbacks now use `~/Development/<name>`.
- Compound batches must never pass a secret via
  `docker run -e VAR="$(cat …)"` — that puts the credential in docker's
  own argv (visible in `ps`, history, `docker inspect`). Same
  "secrets are file-based, never CLI" rule already in the container
  `CLAUDE.md`, now also applied to instructions I hand Arfy.

### Upgrade

Image rebuild REQUIRED (unlike 3.2.4→3.3.3 which were wrapper-only).
`./install.sh` picks up the wrapper's DRIDOCK_VERSION bump; `make build`
in the harness clone rebuilds `dridock:latest` with the entrypoint +
api_server fixes baked. Anyone running api/telegram/cron modes on the
full image today has a broken deployment — this is the fix.

### Bear-side verification

- `test_api.sh` MCP subset (5 tests) re-run against a rebuilt minimal
  test image: **5/5 GREEN**. No regression from the transport-security
  change.
- Live curl smoke: `initialize` with spoofed `Host: 192.168.99.99:18945`
  now HTTP 200 (was 400 pre-fix).
- Syntax: entrypoint.sh + api_server.py clean.

#33 end-to-end verification requires the full image (pyenv only exists
there). Bear can't rebuild the full image in-container quickly; Arfy
runs `make build` on Mac + retests. Compound batch coming after this
push.

## [3.3.3] — 2026-07-21 _(fork)_

### Fixed

- **#32 f/u2** — the `dridock migrate` verb dispatch ended with an
  unconditional `exit 0` even when it printed `⚠ done, resolve and re-run`
  (the split-brain / live-cdp guard case). Message right, exit code
  wrong. Automation (`dridock migrate || alert`, setup scripts, Makefile
  targets) saw success on a half-successful run. One-token change: `exit
  "${_mig_state_rc:-0}"`. The same silent-drop family the whole 3.3.x
  series has been draining — this closes the one remaining caller class
  the 3.3.1/3.3.2 signals still lied to.

- **#25** — test-infra rename miss. `tests/common.sh` still declared
  `IMAGE_NAME="claudebox"`, `CONTAINER_PREFIX="claudebox-test"`, and
  `CBX_TEST_WS=".../claudebox-test-ws"` — the throwaway test image built
  in-container was tagged `claudebox:test` post-3.0-rebrand. Cosmetic
  (invisible outside the suite) but confusing when reading test output.
  Now `dridock:test` / `dridock-test` / `dridock-test-ws`. Also updated
  `tests/test_entrypoint.sh` (`FROM dridock:test`) and
  `tests/test_e2e_telegram.sh` (internal shell-var `E2E_CLAUDEBOX_NAME`
  → `E2E_DRIDOCK_NAME`, `_e2e_run_claudebox_cron_tg` →
  `_e2e_run_dridock_cron_tg`, container name prefixes, prose refs).
  Internal renames only — no external contract broken.

### Added

- **#28** — two new tests in `tests/test_cron.sh`:
  - **`test_cron_6field_sub_minute_fires`** — verifies the sub-minute
    CADENCE of a `*/20 * * * * *` schedule (previously only the FIRST
    firing was tested via `test_cron_end_to_end_fires`). Expects ≥2
    firings in 60s.
  - **`test_cron_overlap_protection`** — verifies cron.py's per-job
    lock skips a fire while the previous run is still active. Uses a
    haiku instruction that takes 5-15s on a `*/10` schedule; expects
    fewer completed runs than boundaries hit AND ≥1 skip log line.

  Both are haiku-driven (cron.py has no shell-exec path, only
  `instruction`) so they cost 2-4 haiku calls each; still an order
  of magnitude cheaper than the leave-it-untested regression risk.

- **`tests/test_cbvm.sh`** — source-level assertion that the `migrate`
  verb's trailing `exit` uses `"${_mig_state_rc..."`, not a hardcoded
  `exit 0`. Catches the specific class of regression that's now
  committed itself into 3.3.1 + 3.3.2. Bear-side: **154/0** (was
  153/0).

### House rule — CLAUDE.md

Added a new convention (last bullet in "Conventions worth knowing"):

> Never silently discard user state or user-supplied input — fail fast
> or say so loudly. When code accepts an input (flag, env var, config
> value) or performs an operation (move, migrate, forward), the outcome
> must be either fully applied OR a visible, non-zero signal to the
> caller.

Names the five instances that motivated the rule (#17, #30, #31,
#32-A, #32-B) and calls out that the class was reproduced INSIDE the
fix for #32 twice. Every future skip / drop / override must print
stderr AND return a rc a caller can act on.

## [3.3.2] — 2026-07-21 _(fork)_

### Fixed — 3.3.1 exit-contract bug in the live-Chrome guard

**#32 f/u** — Arfy verified 3.3.1 against real state and closed #29
(three durable stores migrated cleanly), but caught a follow-on bug in
the live-Chrome guard itself: it correctly protected the Chrome debug
profile from `mv`, but forgot `split=1` before its `continue`. So
`cb_migrate_state_dirs` returned 0, and `dridock migrate` printed
`✅ done.` when it had silently skipped cdp — exactly the
silent-success-over-discarded-work pattern the guard exists to prevent
(#17 / #30 / #31 / #32 originals), reproduced inside the fix for it.

One-line source change: `split=1` before the guard's `continue`. Now the
verb takes the `⚠ done, resolve and re-run` branch and the user sees
that cdp needs a re-migrate after they close Chrome.

Data safety was **never** compromised — the guard did skip the `mv`; only
the SIGNAL that it skipped was lost.

### Added — pgrep-stub coverage for the live-cdp guard

`tests/test_cbvm.sh` gains a live-cdp assertion block using Arfy's
`exec -a` trick: bash spawns a stub whose argv[0] is the exact Chrome
command line, `pgrep -f` matches it, and the guard fires as if a real
Chrome were running. Four assertions:
- exit contract: `cb_migrate_state_dirs` returns non-zero when skipped
- SKIPPING message present
- canary marker in the legacy cdp preserved (data-safety)
- nothing leaked into `dridock/cdp`

Bear-side: 153/0 (was 149/0 — 4 new assertions).

## [3.3.1] — 2026-07-21 _(fork)_

### Fixed — 3.2.4 regression in `cb_migrate_state_dirs`

**#32** — Arfy caught both defects in a sandbox before running live migration.

**Defect A (blocker)** — `cb_migrate_state_dirs` did a bare `mv` on `cdp/`
with no check for whether Chrome was running against the debug profile.
`~/.config/claudebox/cdp/` is a full Chrome debug profile (3k+ files on
Arfy's Mac) actively in use by `dridock browser-bridge`; `mv` renames the
inode, Chrome's open fds follow, but the profile's SingletonLock and
Preferences encode absolute paths — next launch silently starts a fresh
profile OR errors. Made worse by `cb_auto_migrate` firing this on ANY
`dridock` invocation (opt-out, not opt-in). Now a `pgrep -f -- "--user-data-dir=$old"`
check skips the cdp move if Chrome is running against it, with an
actionable message pointing at `dridock browser-bridge down` and re-run.
Skip is safe: `_cb_state_home` falls back to the legacy path.

**Defect B** — when BOTH `~/.config/{dridock,claudebox}/$name` existed
(realistic path: user works on 3.2.4 without migrating, `_cb_state_home`
creates `dridock/$name`, then explicit `migrate` hits this branch), the
old code printed `"leaving both"` and returned success. `_cb_state_home`
unconditionally prefers `dridock/`, so legacy content became silently
unreachable — 7 consult threads would be stranded on Arfy's Mac. Now:
`cb_migrate_state_dirs` **merges** the two roots instead of orphaning —
non-colliding entries move into `dridock/$name` cleanly (returns 0 with
a `merged N entries` count); filename collisions get a `.legacy-<ts>`
suffix so both copies stay reachable and the user picks the winner
(returns non-zero to force attention). The Chrome profile (`cdp/`) is
explicitly excluded from auto-merge — its thousands of interdependent
files don't merge safely — and gets a "close Chrome and pick one"
message. `_cb_state_home` also prints a per-read SPLIT warning (deduped
per name per shell) so state can't scroll off unnoticed if the user
recreates the situation between migrations. The explicit `migrate` verb
ends with `⚠ done` + "resolve and re-run" instead of `✅ done` when any
collision or refusal occurred.

Same silent-drop family as #17 / #30 / #31 — and the first instance that
could damage state the user did not ask us to touch. See Arfy's #32 body
for the "never silently discard user state" house-rule proposal.

### Added — `tests/test_cbvm.sh` coverage for both guards

Five new test blocks under `cb_migrate_state_dirs`:
- **happy path** — all four subdirs relocate, content preserved, legacy gone.
- **clean-merge split-brain** — non-colliding entries merge into dridock/,
  rc 0, `merged N entries` message, legacy subdir removed.
- **collision split-brain** — colliding filename kept with `.legacy-<ts>`
  suffix, dridock/ copy authoritative, rc non-zero.
- **cdp split-brain** — refused explicitly (no auto-merge for Chrome
  profile), rc non-zero, both roots untouched.
- **`_cb_state_home` read-time** — split warning fires on read; dridock/
  still wins; deduped per name per shell.

Bear-side in-container: 149/0 (was 130/0 — 19 new assertions).

### Upgrade notice

Everyone on 3.2.4 or 3.3.0 who has a live browser-bridge Chrome running
should upgrade to 3.3.1 BEFORE running any `dridock` command. Auto-migrate
fired without a guard could corrupt the Chrome debug profile. Fix ships
without needing a `make build`: `./install.sh` from the canonical clone
picks up the new wrapper.

## [3.3.0] — 2026-07-21 _(fork)_

### Added — host↔image contract change (`-env` sidecar)

- **#30 Part 1** — `DRIDOCK_ENV_*` / `CLAUDEBOX_ENV_*` / `CLAUDE_ENV_*`
  forwarded values now persist across `docker start`. The wrapper writes a
  chmod-600 `~/.claude/.<container>-env` sidecar (KEY=VALUE) each run
  alongside the existing `-e` flags; the entrypoint's `_load_env_sidecar
  env forwarded-env` (sixth call in the loader block) re-reads it on every
  start. Pre-3.3.0 these forwards ONLY rode `-e` on `docker run`, so a
  changed value on a subsequent invocation of an existing container
  silently no-op'd — a recurring rediscovery that cost multiple debug
  sessions.

  **Behavior details:**
  - **Changed value** — set `DRIDOCK_ENV_FOO=y` on a container originally
    created with `FOO=x`: takes effect on the next run.
  - **Explicit clear** — set `DRIDOCK_ENV_FOO=` (empty): sidecar loader
    UNSETs `FOO`, so a value baked in at container-create time is dropped.
  - **Removed forward** — omit `DRIDOCK_ENV_FOO` on a subsequent run: the
    baked value from container-create PERSISTS (loader only knows what
    the sidecar names). To fully drop, either explicit-clear once or
    recreate the container. `--recreate` shortcut is #30 Part 2.

  **Security**: the sidecar is chmod 600 (like `-auth` and `-secrets`) —
  `DRIDOCK_ENV_*` values can legitimately carry credentials
  (`DRIDOCK_ENV_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is a documented pattern), so
  0600-file-only is strictly better than `-e`-in-docker-argv leak surface.

### Migration

MINOR bump per docs/versioning.md — new sidecar filename + format is a
host↔image contract change. Wrapper 3.3.0 writes `-env` sidecars that
older entrypoints ignore (harmless); entrypoint 3.3.0 loads `-env`
sidecars that older wrappers don't write (harmless — loader no-ops on
missing file). No user action needed on upgrade. `dridock checkversion`
will warn about the wrapper↔image version gap until `make build`.

## [3.2.5] — 2026-07-21 _(fork)_

### Fixed

- **#31** — `wrapper.sh` now validates the value of `--effort` against the
  closed set `low|medium|high|xhigh|max`, matching the `--output-format`
  pattern already in the same `case` block. Prior behavior: `--effort bogus`
  (or a plausible typo like `--effort hihg`) was accepted, exit 0, run
  completed at default effort with no signal anywhere — the same silent-
  drop family as #17 (claude CLI silently ignores unrecognized input rather
  than erroring) and #30 (DRIDOCK_ENV_* on restarted containers). Both
  `--effort X` and `--effort=X` spellings are validated. `--model` is
  deliberately excluded — model names rot with each release and an
  allowlist would start rejecting valid models. Filed by Arfy during #18
  coverage-gap verification.

### Added

- **`test_programmatic_effort_invalid`** and
  **`test_programmatic_effort_valid_pass_validation`** in
  `tests/test_programmatic.sh` — durable regression checks for #31. Both
  work on the docker backend (validation fires before `cb_ensure_infra`),
  so bear-side in-container CI verifies them without a colima VM.

## [3.2.4] — 2026-07-21 _(fork)_

### Fixed — defect sweep from #18 QA (bear + arfy)

Three 3.0-rebrand blind spots (each a different syntactic shape than the
prior sweeps caught) plus two test-fixture defects, all surfaced during the
mode-verification pass on issues #18–#23:

- **#26** — the four Python daemons (`api_server.py`, `cron.py`,
  `telegram_bot.py`, `telegram_utils.py`) were reading their config env
  via `os.environ.get("CLAUDEBOX_X")` on the legacy name only (10 sites).
  The container-side aliaser masked it today; 4.0 would silently break
  auth/config for any user who set the `DRIDOCK_X` name. Migrated all 10
  sites to `os.environ.get("DRIDOCK_X") or os.environ.get("CLAUDEBOX_X") or
  os.environ.get("CLAUDE_X", default)` — three-tier fallback matching the
  cb-* helper migration in 3.2.2. Also fixed `api_server.py` error message
  and `cron.py` docstring to reference `DRIDOCK_MODE_CRON_FILE` etc.
- **#29** — four host-side state subdirs (`cdp`, `consult`,
  `framework-bugs`, `host-agent`) still hardcoded `~/.config/claudebox/`
  and `dridock migrate` did not relocate them, silently splitting durable
  state across two roots indefinitely — the "3 framework bug report(s)
  on file" warning was reading from the legacy path in current 3.2.3
  output. `wrapper.sh` now uses a `_cb_state_home <subname>` helper with
  the per-subdir dridock/-preferred, claudebox/-fallback pattern (same
  shape as `cb_xdg_dir`), and `cb_migrate_state_dirs` moves the four
  subdirs when `dridock migrate` (or auto-migrate) runs.
- **`test_cron.sh:77`** stale assertion — `cron.py:423` was updated during
  3.0 to say `DRIDOCK_MODE_CRON_FILE not set` but the test still asserted
  the legacy string. Fixed the assertion.
- **`test_programmatic_bad_auth`** false-pass — asserted `exit != 0` only,
  which the "cb-infra colima profile not found" wrapper-startup error
  also produces. Now additionally requires stderr to mention
  auth/credential/token/oauth/401 so wrapper-startup failures don't
  masquerade as "auth was checked and rejected".

### Added

- **`test_programmatic_auto_continue`** — durable regression check for the
  auto-continue behavior, using **sessionId** in the JSON output rather
  than model recall. The recall-based approach in #18's manual batch
  produced a false-negative from Claude Code's persistent memory writing
  "remember the number N" to a memory file that a fresh session read back;
  sessionId is the direct semantic invariant. House rule for future test
  authoring: never assert on model recall of an arbitrary value.
- **`test_programmatic_json_schema`** — durable regression check for
  `--json-schema`, using inline JSON as the flag actually accepts (a
  path-argument fixture at #18 verify hit a JSON parse error).

### Migration

`dridock migrate` (and the auto-migrate hook) now relocates the four
`~/.config/claudebox/{cdp,consult,framework-bugs,host-agent}` directories
to `~/.config/dridock/`. Users who already ran `dridock migrate` before
3.2.4 should run it again to pick up the new subdirs. Read-fallback
means unmigrated legacy subdirs remain readable for one deprecation cycle.

## [3.2.3] — 2026-07-21 _(fork)_

### Fixed

- **Systematic post-3.0-rebrand audit closed 15 more legacy-only reads**
  (#16 f/u2). `tests/test_rename_completeness.sh` (new — 7-sweep diagnostic
  covering bare `${CLAUDEBOX_X:-}` reads, hardcoded `.claudebox/` paths,
  `claudebox:latest` image tag, XDG `.config/claudebox/` +
  `.local/share/claudebox/`, `skills/claudebox/`, `claudebox <verb>` in
  user-facing strings, and `env-rename.map` completeness) surfaced them.
  All in code that Phase 5's ad-hoc sweep missed:

  - `install.sh` — 6 env vars gained `${DRIDOCK_X:-${CLAUDEBOX_X:-…}}`
    fallbacks: `INSTALL_DIR`, `MINIMAL`, `INFRA_PROFILE`, `INFRA_CPU`,
    `INFRA_MEMORY`, `INFRA_DISK`, `SKIP_SHELL_HELPERS`, `SHARE_DIR`.
  - `tests/common.sh` — `CLAUDEBOX_BACKEND` → `DRIDOCK_BACKEND`-first
    (backend selection in the test harness).
  - `run-e2e-cron-telegram.sh` + `tests/test_e2e_telegram.sh` — 3 sites
    reading `CLAUDEBOX_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` bare now prefer
    `DRIDOCK_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` with the legacy as fallback.

- **`~/.local/share/{dridock,claudebox}/` collision handling** (install.sh
  post-2.x-upgrade case). Mirrors the existing `cb_xdg_dir` pattern for
  `~/.config/…`: install writes to `~/.local/share/dridock/` (new
  default), the wrapper reads from `dridock/` first with `claudebox/` as
  fallback (so a 2.x user whose `~/.zshrc` still sources the legacy path
  isn't stranded), and if both dirs co-exist post-upgrade install.sh
  prints a one-liner note recommending `rm -rf` of the legacy dir.
  Never auto-moves — user might have their own files there.

### Added

- **`env-rename.map` gained 14 pairs** the ad-hoc renaming missed —
  `DRIDOCK_INSTALL_DIR`, `DRIDOCK_INFRA_{PROFILE,CPU,MEMORY,DISK}`,
  `DRIDOCK_SKIP_{SHELL_HELPERS,SKILL}`, `DRIDOCK_SHARE_DIR`,
  `DRIDOCK_BACKEND`, `DRIDOCK_NO_{OAUTH_TOKEN,AUTO_MIGRATE}`,
  `DRIDOCK_MODE_{API,API_PORT,API_TOKEN,TELEGRAM}`,
  `DRIDOCK_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`. The container-side aliaser and host-side
  wrapper alias both pick these up automatically now — the whole point
  of the shared-map design in 3.2.1.

- **`tests/test_rename_completeness.sh`** (new, 7 sweeps, diagnostic
  runnable as `bash tests/test_rename_completeness.sh -v` for detail).
  Exit 1 on any FAIL (real bug); WARN-only is exit 0. Sweep types:
  bare CLAUDEBOX_X reads outside cb-*, hardcoded `.claudebox/` paths,
  `claudebox:latest` image tag, XDG paths, `skills/claudebox/`,
  `claudebox <verb>` in user-facing strings, `env-rename.map`
  completeness (every used `${DRIDOCK_X}` has a map entry or an
  explicit exemption for prefixes / test fixtures / internal names).
  OK-detection is smart: recognizes elif/case legacy branches, paired
  gitignore lines, migration string literals in legacy-aware files,
  and same-line fallback shapes. Down from 26 FAILs on first run to
  0 after the ~15 real bugs were fixed.

- **`~/.local/share/claudebox/env-rename.map`** added to the wrapper's
  map-lookup fallback list — so a 2.x user who happens to have that
  path populated (unlikely, but zero-cost defensive) still finds the
  aliases. New installs always write to `dridock/`.

## [3.2.2] — 2026-07-21 _(fork)_

### Changed

- **Baked `cb-*` helpers migrated to read `${DRIDOCK_X:-${CLAUDEBOX_X:-…}}`
  at every site**, so 4.0's shim removal doesn't strand them. 3.2.1's
  entrypoint aliaser papered over legacy-name reads at runtime; that
  worked but a claudebot in the wild (`51cb139f`) rightly flagged that
  4.0 (or any container path that skips the entrypoint) would silently
  regress them. All 14 legacy-name reads across the 5 baked helpers now
  prefer the canonical DRIDOCK_ name with CLAUDEBOX_ as fallback:
  - `cb-browser` (6 reads: VM_IP + HOST_CDP_URL)
  - `cb-consult` (2 reads: CONSULT_DIR + PROJECT_ID)
  - `cb-report-bug` (2 reads: FRAMEWORK_BUGS_DIR + PROJECT_ID)
  - `cb-harness-watch-consults` (3 reads: CONSULT_DIR +
    FRAMEWORK_BUGS_DIR + HARNESS_WATCH_INTERVAL)
  - `cb-host-shim` (2 reads: HOST_AGENT_URL + HOST_AGENT_TOKEN)

  `cb-browser`'s Playwright-in-a-sub-container `docker run --network host`
  now also exports BOTH DRIDOCK_ and CLAUDEBOX_ names via `-e` (the
  entrypoint's alias shim doesn't reach a sub-container that bypasses
  it). User-facing help + error strings updated to name DRIDOCK_ first.

### Added

- **Lint** in `tests/test_env_rename_compat.sh` — scans every `cb-*`
  helper for `${CLAUDEBOX_X:-…}` reads, fails if any appear without a
  sibling `${DRIDOCK_X:-` fallback (docker `-e CLAUDEBOX_X=…`
  passthrough is exempted as a legit sub-container env passthrough).
  Verified: fires on a synthetic regression (17→16 passed with 1
  intentionally-broken probe file), passes cleanly on the migrated
  tree (17/0). This is the forcing function that keeps the migration
  intact — any new bare-legacy read in a `cb-*` helper trips the build
  immediately instead of silently accumulating.

## [3.2.1] — 2026-07-21 _(fork)_

### Fixed

- **`CLAUDEBOX_*` → `DRIDOCK_*` env compat now covers container-internal reads
  too, not just host-side** (#16, framework consult
  `2026-07-21T01-31-28-unknown`). The 3.0 rebrand promised "all of 3.x accepts
  `CLAUDEBOX_*` env" but only wired the host side (wrapper's `_dridock_alias`);
  the entrypoint injected only `DRIDOCK_*` into the container, and every baked
  `cb-*` helper written before the rename (cb-browser, cb-consult, cb-report-bug,
  cb-harness-watch-consults, cb-host-shim) still reads `CLAUDEBOX_*` at each
  site. Result: `cb-browser cdp` hard-failed "no host CDP bridge" on a fresh
  3.x session even though the bridge was fully up.

  Fix: a symmetric container-side aliaser (`_dridock_alias_env` in
  entrypoint.sh), driven by the same rename map the host wrapper reads.

  - **New `env-rename.map` at repo root** — single source of truth for every
    renamed pair. 42 entries: the 36 host-facing envs the wrapper already
    aliased, plus 5 container-only ones (`DRIDOCK_VM_IP`, `DRIDOCK_PROJECT_ID`,
    `DRIDOCK_HOST_AGENT_URL`, `DRIDOCK_HOST_AGENT_TOKEN`,
    `DRIDOCK_HARNESS_WATCH_INTERVAL`) that the entrypoint injects but the
    wrapper never needed. A new rename is one line in this file.
  - **`wrapper.sh`** refactored: `_dridock_alias` now loops over the shared
    map instead of 36 hardcoded call lines. Same behavior; one file to grep.
  - **`entrypoint.sh:_dridock_alias_env`** — new function, runs AFTER
    `_load_env_sidecar` (sidecars are the durability layer; running the
    aliaser first would let a stale legacy env baked into an older
    `docker run -e` shadow an intentionally-empty sidecar entry).
    Symmetric mirror: `DRIDOCK_X` set → export `CLAUDEBOX_X`; `CLAUDEBOX_X`
    set → export `DRIDOCK_X`; both set → don't clobber; neither set → both
    stay unset.
  - **`Dockerfile`** bakes `env-rename.map` to `/usr/local/lib/dridock/`;
    **`install.sh`** copies it to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/dridock/` on the host so
    the wrapper picks it up post-install.
  - **New standard** [`docs/design/env-var-rename.md`](docs/design/env-var-rename.md) —
    documents the mechanism, sidecar-ordering rule, 4.0-removal timeline, and
    the "don't roll per-helper compat" convention. Cross-linked from
    3.0-migration.md § "Backward compat window", convenience-scripts.md, and
    the docs index.
  - **Baked `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`** guidance gains one line noting the
    interchangeability during 3.x — prevents future claudebots from getting
    confused seeing both names in `env`.
  - **`tests/test_env_rename_compat.sh`** (new, 16 asserts) — extracts the
    aliaser function from entrypoint.sh, source-and-invokes it against a
    scratch map, and pins the symmetric-mirror semantics. Also parses the
    map file itself (every non-comment line = two shell idents) and guards
    that the critical container-only pairs are present (regression guard
    for the exact class of leak in #16).
  - **Follow-up (non-blocking, not part of this fix)**: migrate the five
    baked cb-* helpers to read `${DRIDOCK_X:-${CLAUDEBOX_X:-}}` at each
    site opportunistically, so 4.0's shim-removal doesn't strand them.

- **SessionStart consult hook now works inside a framework-dev container**,
  not only on the Mac. Pre-3.2.1 the hook (`.claude/hooks/consult-session-start.sh`)
  looked for `~/.config/claudebox/consult` and nudged `claudebox consult watch`
  — both host-only paths. Inside the container it silently exited (the consult
  dir is at `$DRIDOCK_CONSULT_DIR`, and the in-container watcher verb is
  `cb-harness-watch-consults`). Missed the 2026-07-21T01:31 consult that
  triggered #16. Hook now detects `[ -f /.dockerenv ]`, resolves both paths
  and both verbs, and nudges the correct one for the environment. Same silent
  no-op semantics when nothing is pending AND a watcher is already running.

## [3.2.0] — 2026-07-20 _(fork)_

### Changed

- **`create-react-app` is no longer baked into the `full` image, and the other
  framework scaffolders (`@vue/cli`, `@angular/cli`, `express-generator`) moved
  to a new opt-in `web-scaffolders` feature** (#14). CRA was deprecated by
  React in early 2023; keeping it baked shipped obsolete tooling to every
  claudebot. The other framework CLIs are niche enough that most projects
  don't need them baked. Anyone who wants them:

  ```bash
  dridock features enable web-scaffolders
  ```

  installs `create-vite`, `create-next-app` (the modern CRA replacements),
  `@vue/cli`, `@angular/cli`, and `express-generator` on the next boot.
  Off with `dridock features disable web-scaffolders`.

  **Not moved** (still baked, broadly useful across JS/TS projects): `eslint`,
  `prettier`, `typescript`, `typescript-language-server`, `pyright`, `ts-node`,
  `@typescript-eslint/parser`, `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`, `nodemon`,
  `pm2`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, `newman`, `http-server`, `serve`, `lighthouse`,
  `@storybook/cli`. Second non-LSP feature to ship under 3.0's features
  system (`modeguard` was the first).

  **User-visible break**: if a project's `~/.claude/init.d/` hook or claudebot
  workflow assumes any of the moved tools are on PATH, either enable
  `web-scaffolders` in that project's `.dridock/config.yml` or `npm install -g`
  the specific tool in the hook. CRA specifically has no baked replacement —
  use `npx create-vite` or `npx create-next-app` instead (recommended by React).

## [3.1.0] — 2026-07-20 _(fork)_

### Security

- **Credentials no longer travel on any command line.** Surfaced during #17, when a live
  `GH_TOKEN` appeared in ordinary `ps` output and from there in a pasted transcript. The
  harness kept secrets in 0600 files host-side — correctly — and then undid that at the
  last hop, in three places:

  | surface | who could read it | status |
  |---|---|---|
  | container argv (`/proc/1/cmdline`, mode **444**) | **any uid** in the container | fixed |
  | host argv (Mac `ps aux`, `docker run -e K=V`) | any local user, whole session | fixed |
  | `docker inspect` `Config.Env` | anything holding the docker socket | fixed |

  For contrast, `/proc/1/environ` is mode **400** (and not even root-readable in-container
  without `CAP_SYS_PTRACE`). Secrets belong in the environment, never in argv — the same
  rule `CLAUDE.md` already stated for host-side flags, now actually enforced end to end.

  - **entrypoint**: the five sidecar readers (`-auth`, `-secrets`, `-cdp`, `-vmip`,
    `-hostagent`) collapse into one `_load_env_sidecar()` that performs **real `export`s
    in the entrypoint's own shell**, instead of appending `export K=<value>` to the string
    later run as `bash -c` (which published every value in PID 1's argv). It uses
    `export "$name=$value"` with no `printf %q` and no `eval`, so a value containing shell
    metacharacters is data, never code.
  - **coverage fix, found on the way**: the loader is hoisted **above** the mode dispatch.
    The API / telegram / cron daemons `exec` before the CMD string is ever built, so the
    old CMD-string exports never reached them — those modes worked *only* because the
    wrapper also passed `-e`. Dropping `-e` without this would have silently broken
    daemon auth.
  - **wrapper**: stops passing `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`,
    `DRIDOCK_HOST_AGENT_TOKEN` and every `secrets.env` value via `-e`. The durable
    sidecars are now the sole channel — which they already had to be, since `docker start`
    cannot take new env. The one entrypoint-bypassing path (`dridock auth`/`mcp`, which
    runs `--entrypoint claude` and so never reads sidecars) uses a 0600 temp
    `--env-file`, putting only a *path* in argv. Empty entries are filtered out, because
    `--env-file` would turn a bare `KEY=` into a set-but-empty var that claude reads as a
    present, broken credential.
  - **tests**: guards on both halves — no non-`HOME`/`PATH` export may enter the CMD
    string, and the wrapper may not put a credential on a docker command line.

  Verified end to end on a real container: the secret still reaches the app, a value
  containing `$ ; &` and spaces arrives verbatim, an empty sidecar entry still unsets, and
  the canary is absent from `/proc/1/cmdline` read as an unprivileged `nobody`.

### Fixed

- **`KEY= value` in a sidecar exported a value with a leading space.** The loader split on
  `=` and kept every surrounding character, so one stray space after the `=` in a
  hand-edited `secrets.env` produced `GH_TOKEN=" ghp_…"` — every GitHub API call from that
  claudebot rejected, with nothing in any log explaining why. Found in the wild while
  cleaning up after the leak above: one project had been silently failing this way.
  `_load_env_sidecar()` now trims whitespace around both name and value, tolerates CRLF
  files and a final line with no newline, still splits on the FIRST `=` only (so
  `URL=https://u:p@h/x?a=b&c=d` survives intact), and skips names that aren't valid shell
  identifiers with a visible warning instead of letting `export` fail obscurely. Covered by
  executable tests that lift the real function out of `entrypoint.sh` and run it.

- **`dridock bootstrap` printed "▶ starting claudebot…" and then started nothing.** It
  re-entered the wrapper as `exec "$0"`, and bare `dridock` has printed a banner and exited
  since #12 / 2.24.0. Now `exec "$0" start`; the companion "enter later with" hint was
  wrong the same way. A test forbids verb-less self re-entry. (Seventh site of this class,
  after the six corrected in 3.0.3.)

  **Rotate any credential used with an earlier version** — assume prior `secrets.env`
  values were exposed to anything that ran `ps` on the Mac or in the container.

## [3.0.3] — 2026-07-20 _(fork)_

### Fixed

- **`--remote-control` was silently dropped: the image's Claude Code was too old**
  (#17). This is the actual root cause behind the "RC inactive" symptom that #16
  chased into the auth layer. The image pinned `ARG CLAUDE_VERSION=2.1.123`, which
  **predates Remote Control entirely** — no `--remote-control` flag, no
  `remote-control` subcommand, and a `claude doctor` that only checks the
  auto-updater. Claude Code **ignores unknown flags without erroring** (verified:
  `claude --remote-control --version` exits 0 on 2.1.123), so dridock passed the
  flag, claude discarded it, the session started clean, and RC never activated —
  with no diagnostic from any layer.

  The auth work in #16 was sound but was not what blocked Alan's case: his stored
  credential was already a full-scope claude.ai OAuth login (Max plan, including the
  `user:sessions:claude_code` scope), with both auth env vars correctly cleared.

  - **Pin bumped to `2.1.215`** (Remote Control needs `>= 2.1.206`). The pin is a
    hard floor: `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1` plus the entrypoint's `.autoUpdates = false`
    patch mean a container can never update itself off it.
  - **Host-side capability check** — `dridock start --remote-control` compares the
    image's actual Claude Code version against the floor before launching and explains
    the silent-flag-drop if it's too old, instead of letting RC fail invisibly. This
    lives in `wrapper.sh`, **not** the entrypoint: probing `claude` from the entrypoint
    deadlocks PID 1 (see the tty fix below), so the entrypoint carries a comment
    warning against reintroducing it.
  - **`dridock checkversion` reports the baked Claude Code CLI version** and warns
    when it is below `CB_CLAUDE_CLI_FLOOR` (2.1.206). The CLI version is a second
    version axis, independent of the harness semver, and nothing surfaced it before —
    which is why a 92-release-stale CLI went unnoticed.

- **First container start no longer stalls 90s and then lies about it.** The default
  plugin installer (and the feature installer) ran `claude` from the entrypoint without
  redirecting stdin. PID 1 owns the container's tty, so the helper sat in a
  non-foreground process group, took SIGTTOU/SIGTTIN on first terminal access and
  stopped (ps state `T`) — `timeout` can't cleanly rescue a STOPPED process, so every
  tty-attached first start burned the full timeout and then reported
  `not installed (offline?)`, which was never true. Both call sites now pass
  `</dev/null`; measured on a tty-attached start: exit 124 (timeout) before, exit 0
  after, and time-to-session 90s+ -> 9s. The misleading "(offline?)" wording now also
  admits the timeout case. This is a **pre-existing bug**, not a 3.0.3 regression — it
  surfaced because the #17 work put a second claude invocation on the same path.

- **Stale "run `dridock`" advice corrected to `dridock start`** (6 sites). Bare
  `dridock` became info-only in #12 / 2.24.0 (prints version + hint, exits 0) but
  several messages still told users to run it to reseed a drifted project image or
  to initialize a new project — advice that silently does nothing. Includes the
  `checkversion` drift hint, which is exactly the message this release adds output
  next to.

### Docs

- `docs/design/git-and-api-auth.md` — new "Remote Control prerequisite: the baked CLI
  version" section, placed **before** the auth troubleshooting so the cheap check comes
  first. Corrected the credential path: full-scope logins land in
  `~/.claude/.credentials.json` (mode 0600), **not** `.claude.json`. Documented the
  container-specific "paste the code" OAuth fallback (the browser can't reach claude's
  local callback server from inside a container).

## [3.0.2] — 2026-07-20 _(fork)_

### Fixed

- **`--remote-control` now activatable in dridock** (#16). Anthropic gates
  Remote Control behind a full-scope claude.ai OAuth login and explicitly
  rejects setup-token-style `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (model-request scope
  only). Dridock defaulted to setup-token throughout, so RC silently
  refused to register even when the flag reached claude (fixed in 3.0.1).
  Three changes make RC usable:
  - **`dridock auth` passthrough now uses `-it`** — so `dridock auth login`
    (Anthropic's browser OAuth flow) can print the URL and wait for callback.
    Without a TTY, the flow couldn't complete.
  - **New env `DRIDOCK_NO_OAUTH_TOKEN=1`** — mirrors `DRIDOCK_NO_API_KEY`;
    suppresses forwarding of `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` so a user who did
    `claude auth login` inside the container can have the stored full-scope
    credentials win over the env var (which otherwise takes precedence).
  - **Entrypoint hint**: on any interactive start where `--remote-control`
    (or `--rc`) is in the sidecar AND `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is set,
    print a one-liner explaining the exact fix (`claude auth login` + set
    `DRIDOCK_NO_OAUTH_TOKEN=1`). Better than "RC inactive" going unnoticed.

  Docs: new "Claude Code auth" section in `docs/design/git-and-api-auth.md`
  covering the API-key / setup-token / full-OAuth trichotomy. README's
  Authentication section adds the `--remote-control` recipe. Not needed:
  the host-agent proxy I initially feared — Anthropic's RC works fine over
  outbound HTTPS + polling, so no networking design surface here.

## [3.0.1] — 2026-07-20 _(fork)_

### Fixed

- **`dridock start <flag>` now actually forwards `<flag>` to `claude`.** 2.24.1's
  fix for `❌ Unknown flag: --remote-control` cleared the strict validator's
  rejection but left the forwarding half-done — the interactive-start path
  (both new `docker run -it` and re-attach `docker start -ai`) never passed
  user-supplied claude flags through to the entrypoint, so `dridock start
  --remote-control` (or any other flag) was silently dropped. Wrapper now
  writes remaining `$@` to a durable `.<container>-interactive-args` sidecar
  before start/create; the entrypoint's interactive branch reads it, splices
  the contents into the `claude` command line, and removes the sidecar (same
  pattern as `_prog-args` / `-no-continue` / `-update`). Covers both
  first-run `docker run` (fresh container) and `docker start -ai` (existing).
  Sidecar cleared each run so a subsequent argless `dridock start` doesn't
  inherit stale flags. Fix reported by Alan the morning after the 3.0.0 ship
  (bot in gammaray showed `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --continue …`
  with no `--remote-control` even though the wrapper accepted the flag).

### Features

- **`modeguard` feature** (2026-07-20) — first non-LSP entry in the 3.0 features
  system. Opt-in via `dridock features enable modeguard`. Installs a
  `.git/hooks/pre-commit` in the project workspace that refuses commits which
  drop the executable bit (`100755` → `100644`) — the exact failure mode where
  Edit/Write tool paths sometimes silently strip `+x` from scripts and it lands
  in a commit unnoticed. Escape hatch:
  `DRIDOCK_MODEGUARD_ALLOW_MODE_STRIP=1 git commit …` or `--no-verify`. `on.sh`
  refuses to clobber a user-authored `pre-commit` hook (marker-detected);
  `off.sh` only removes the hook it installed. Validates the feature mechanism
  end-to-end for workspace-file-touching features (the shipped LSP features
  only touch Claude Code plugin state).

## [3.0.0] — 2026-07-20 _(fork)_

The coordinated `3.0-bundle` — four breaking-ish issues bundled as one
migration so users pay the reindex cost once. All four shipped in-master
between 2026-07-19 and 2026-07-20; see the per-issue subsections below and
the full [3.0 migration guide](docs/design/3.0-migration.md).

**Breaking / behavioral (all have backward-compat aliases for one deprecation
cycle — removed in 4.0):**
- Fork renamed `claudebox` → `dridock`. Wrapper binary, image tag/label
  (`dridock:latest`, `org.dridock.version`), env-var prefix (`DRIDOCK_*`),
  project dir (`.dridock/`), per-project data dir
  (`~/.config/dridock/projects/`), skill dir (`~/.claude/skills/dridock/`,
  slash-command `/dridock`), profiles dir (`/usr/local/lib/dridock/…`), etc.
  2.x names accepted throughout for one cycle. The `cb-*` container helper
  prefix is KEPT (descriptive "container binary," not the brand).
- `.dridock/config.yml` `features: [...]` replaces `profiles: [...]`.
- Entrypoint no longer runs `gh auth setup-git` — the credential-helper
  hijack root cause is gone. Git-over-HTTPS falls through to SSH; users
  whose `origin` was HTTPS-only must switch it to SSH or install their own
  helper.
- `bootstrap --gh-token` deprecated in favor of provider-agnostic
  `bootstrap --seed-secret KEY=CMD`.
- Baked in-container `/usr/local/bin/dridock` shim unifies the command
  surface — routes container-side verbs to `cb-*`, prints a targeted
  "run on the Mac" for host-only ones.
- Auto-migration: first `dridock` in a `.claudebox/`-only workspace
  migrates it silently (opt out with `DRIDOCK_NO_AUTO_MIGRATE=1`).
  `dridock migrate [--all]` verb for supervised / bulk migration.

**Upgrade path:** `git pull && ./install.sh` on the Mac. First `dridock` in
each existing project auto-migrates. `dridock migrate --all` pre-sweeps
every legacy project data dir under `~/.config/claudebox/projects/`.

### [#5 — features system (MVP)]

- **Landed (2026-07-20)**: `profiles:` → `features:` mechanism ship, backward-
  compat preserved, no behavior changes. New file layout
  `features/<name>/{manifest.yml, on.sh, off.sh}` (replaces flat
  `profiles/<name>.sh`) baked at `/usr/local/lib/dridock/features/`. Existing
  LSP bundles migrated: `go` / `python` / `typescript` — each declares
  `requires-bake: true` in its manifest (metadata for now; language servers
  are already baked as part of the toolchain install), gets an `off.sh` that
  uninstalls the Claude plugin. Config key rename `profiles:` → `features:` in
  `.dridock/config.yml`; both keys accepted for one deprecation cycle. New
  host CLI `dridock features [list | enable <name> | disable <name> | info
  <name>]` — `enable` rewrites the config's `features:` block (portable
  temp-file rewrite, not sed -i); `disable` also clears the enable marker in
  the project's data dir and best-effort runs `off.sh` in the running
  container. `dridock profiles` remains as a legacy alias with a one-line
  deprecation notice. Entrypoint reads new `~/.claude/.features` sidecar
  first, `~/.claude/.profiles` as fallback; recognizes both `.feature-<name>`
  and `.profile-<name>` enable markers so 2.x projects don't re-run
  installers on 3.0's first boot. Container-side `dridock` shim (#1) knows
  about the new `features` verb. Old `profiles/` source dir removed (replaced
  by `features/`). CLI + config exercised end-to-end (enable, enable-again
  idempotent, disable, legacy `profiles:` key read). Full design ADR in
  [docs/design/features-system.md](docs/design/features-system.md); deferred
  items listed there (machine-wide `default_features:`, project-local
  `.dridock/features/`, converting SSH-git / browser-bridge / host-agent to
  features).

### [#1 — unify host↔container command surface]

- **Landed (2026-07-20)**: baked `/usr/local/bin/dridock` shim in the
  image (route: `dridock consult|report-bug|browser|df|help` → the same
  `cb-*` implementation; host-only verbs like `start|stop|vm|ip|net|
  bootstrap|migrate|checkversion|…` exit 2 with a targeted "run this on
  your Mac: `cd $DRIDOCK_WORKSPACE && dridock <verb>`" message instead
  of a generic "unknown command"). Both names work everywhere; `cb-*`
  stays canonical (referenced in help/docs/headers), `dridock <verb>` is
  the reflex-consistent alias with the host CLI. Also bakes a
  `/usr/local/bin/claudebox → dridock` symlink for one deprecation cycle
  (2.x binary-name muscle memory). `cb-help` mentions the unified alias;
  docs/design/convenience-scripts.md updated with the split rationale.

### [#10 — split git-vs-API auth]

- **Follow-up (2026-07-20)**: fresh-container SSH host-key verification.
  With the credential-helper gone, first-connect `git pull|push` against a
  git host hit `StrictHostKeyChecking` on an empty `known_hosts` and
  failed with "Host key verification failed" — the exact symptom Alan hit
  on the first restart. Entrypoint now pre-seeds `~/.ssh/known_hosts` with
  the majors (github.com, gitlab.com, bitbucket.org, codeberg.org) via
  `ssh-keyscan` once per container (versioned stamp), and appends
  `Host * / StrictHostKeyChecking accept-new` to `~/.ssh/config` as the
  catch-all for self-hosted / less common providers. Both writes land in
  the bind-mounted `~/.ssh/` so they persist across restarts. Idempotent:
  re-runs don't duplicate the config block or re-scan the majors.
- **Landed (2026-07-19)**: SSH-for-git, tokens-for-API-only. Entrypoint no
  longer runs `gh auth setup-git` on start — the credential-helper hijack
  root cause is gone. Git-over-HTTPS falls through to SSH via
  `~/.ssh/claudebox/id_ed25519` (path kept for one cycle); one keypair covers
  every provider a user pushes to. `bootstrap` grows a provider-agnostic
  `--seed-secret KEY=CMD` flag (repeatable): runs `CMD` on the host, writes
  stdout as `KEY` in `.dridock/secrets.env` — trimming whitespace so
  `gh auth token`'s leading-space quirk doesn't corrupt the value.
  `--gh-token` is kept as a deprecated alias for `--seed-secret
  GH_TOKEN='gh auth token'` through 3.x. New standard:
  [`docs/design/git-and-api-auth.md`](docs/design/git-and-api-auth.md).
  Behavior break for anyone whose `origin` was HTTPS and relied on the baked
  credential helper — set it to SSH (`git remote set-url origin
  git@…:owner/repo.git`) or install your own helper. `install.sh` prose
  un-softened to point users at SSH for git and per-provider tokens for API.

### [#11 — dridock rebrand]

- **Phase 1 (2026-07-19)**: design decisions locked in
  `docs/design/3.0-migration.md`. Kept: `cb-*` container helpers, `cb-<id>` colima
  profiles, `cb-net`, container name derivation, sidecar file naming, `~/.claude`
  paths. Renamed: env-var prefix, image tag/label, project dir, per-project data dir,
  wrapper binary default, skill dir. Backward-compat for one deprecation cycle
  (`CLAUDEBOX_*` env accepted, `.claudebox/` dir read as fallback, both wrapper.sh
  fingerprint patterns honored).
- **Phase 3 (2026-07-19)**: image tag / label / binary defaults renamed.
  `IMAGE_NAME` default in `Makefile` + `install.sh` flipped `claudebox` → `dridock`
  (image tag becomes `dridock:latest`). `LABEL org.claudebox.version` in `Dockerfile`
  renamed to `org.dridock.version`. `cb_image_status` in `wrapper.sh` reads
  `org.dridock.version` primarily and falls back to `org.claudebox.version` for one
  cycle — so `checkversion` on a 3.0 wrapper against a 2.x image shows the version
  instead of "unstamped." `BIN_NAME` default in `install.sh` flipped `claudebox` →
  `dridock` (wrapper binary installed as `~/.local/bin/dridock`). Wrapper's
  `CLAUDE_IMAGE_NAME` default renamed alongside. Existing installs need to
  reinstall (`./install.sh`) and rebuild (`make build`) to pick up the new tag and
  binary name.
- **Phase 4b (2026-07-19)**: `dridock migrate` verb + auto-migrate. Three
  idempotent helpers move the three layers of 2.x state to the 3.0 layout —
  `cb_migrate_workspace` (project's `.claudebox/*` → `.dridock/*` + rewrite
  `/.claudebox/…` lines in `.gitignore`), `cb_migrate_data_dir` (per-project
  `~/.config/claudebox/projects/<id>/` → `~/.config/dridock/projects/<id>/`),
  `cb_migrate_machine_config` (`~/.config/claudebox/config.yml` → dridock's).
  New verb `dridock migrate` runs the first three for the current project +
  the machine config; `dridock migrate --all` also walks every legacy project
  data dir under `~/.config/claudebox/projects/`. Auto-migrate on the first
  `dridock` invocation in a `.claudebox/`-only project handles the common
  case silently (one info line printed); opt out with
  `DRIDOCK_NO_AUTO_MIGRATE=1`. New `cb_xdg_dir()` helper flips the machine
  config path + baked `data_root` default to prefer `~/.config/dridock/`
  when it exists, falling back to `~/.config/claudebox/` for one cycle. Full
  unit coverage in `tests/test_cbconfig.sh` (workspace + data-dir + machine-
  config migrations, idempotency, gitignore rewrite preserves unrelated
  lines, secrets mode preserved).
- **Phase 4 (2026-07-19)**: project-dir rename `.claudebox/` → `.dridock/`. New
  `cb_project_dot()` helper returns `.dridock` when it exists, `.claudebox` when
  only the legacy dir exists, otherwise the new `.dridock` default — so writers
  route to `.dridock/` on fresh projects while existing 2.x projects keep working
  from `.claudebox/`. `cb_project_config_path`, `cb_secrets_path`,
  `cb_brief_path`, `cb_write_sample`, `cb_init_project_config`, `cb_bootstrap`
  all use it. `cb_ensure_gitignore` writes BOTH `/.dridock/config.yml` +
  `/.dridock/secrets.env` AND the legacy `/.claudebox/*` entries (dedup'd), so a
  workspace opened by either a 2.x or 3.0 wrapper stays clean. Guard predicate
  `cb_in_dotclaudebox` recognizes both `.dridock` and `.claudebox` subpaths;
  `cb_guard_workspace` strips whichever suffix it finds. Entrypoint's baked
  guidance / brief lookup / plugin-marker check the new location first, fall
  back to legacy. Wrapper user-facing messages and `dridock` command names
  updated in the strings that don't need dynamic dot resolution. Tests +
  examples updated to the new dotname.
- **Phase 2 (2026-07-19)**: env var rename `CLAUDEBOX_*` → `DRIDOCK_*` across
  `wrapper.sh` + `entrypoint.sh` + `Dockerfile` + `Makefile`. Wrapper adds a
  `_dridock_alias` compat block at the top that copies every user-supplied
  `CLAUDEBOX_X` value into `DRIDOCK_X` if the new name isn't set — so all in-file
  reads use `DRIDOCK_X` uniformly while legacy invocations continue to work.
  Prefix-based iterations (`ENV_*`, `MOUNT_*`) accept both prefixes inline
  (`DRIDOCK_ENV_*` + `CLAUDEBOX_ENV_*` + `CLAUDE_ENV_*`, similarly `MOUNT_`).
  Framework-dev fingerprint accepts wrapper.sh containing either
  `^DRIDOCK_VERSION=` or `^CLAUDEBOX_VERSION=` for one cycle.
  Wrapper injects only `DRIDOCK_X` names via `-e` — the entrypoint reads only
  `DRIDOCK_X` from container env; the CLAUDEBOX-side aliases are host-wrapper-only.
  ~30 env vars renamed; docs at `docs/environment-variables.md` stay on old names
  until Phase 5's docs pass.

## [2.24.1] — 2026-07-19 _(fork)_

### Fixed
- **`claudebox start --any-flag` no longer errors with "❌ Unknown flag".** Regression
  from 2.24.0's `start` verb: after `start` shifted off, the `$@` reached the strict
  `-p` programmatic-mode arg validator, which enforces a fixed allowlist
  (`-p`/`--print`/`--output-format`/`--model`/…). Any flag outside that list — e.g.
  `claudebox start --remote-control` — got rejected before the code even decided
  whether we were in programmatic mode.
  Fix: pre-scan `$@` for `-p`/`--print`; if absent, skip the strict validator
  entirely and let every arg pass through to interactive `claude` unchanged. The
  validator still applies to genuine `-p` invocations. Reported by Alan; affected
  `claudebox start --remote-control` and `claudebox start -- --remote-control`.
  Host-only (wrapper.sh); no image rebuild.

## [2.24.0] — 2026-07-19 _(fork)_

### Changed (user-visible CLI break)
- **Bare `claudebox` (no args) no longer starts the claudebot.** Now prints the
  wrapper version + a two-line start hint. Rationale: reduces accidental container
  starts from muscle-typing `claudebox` in the wrong dir (a partial mitigation on
  top of 2.15.4's new-project guard), and matches the reflex-inspection habit for
  most CLIs (bare-name = info). Closes #12.
- **`claudebox start`** — new verb; runs what bare `claudebox` used to do
  (start/attach the interactive claudebot for `$PWD`; passes through `-p` + claude
  args unchanged). Explicit-verb requirement is the whole point.

  Migration for muscle-typed workflows: reflex `claudebox` → `claudebox start`.
  Explicit-arg forms (`claudebox -p "..."` etc.) are unaffected — those DO now
  require `start` in front (`claudebox start -p "..."`); pipelines / aliases will
  need updating.

### Added
- **`claudebox completion bash`** — emits a bash completion script for the wrapper's
  current binary name (`$(basename $0)` so `CLAUDEBOX_BIN_NAME=dridock` reinstalls
  get a `_dridock_complete` bound to `dridock`). Completes top-level verbs at word 1
  and sub-verbs / flags at word 2 (`vm ls|usage|gc`, `harness sync [--repair]`,
  `checkversion [--all]`, `consult list|show|approve|watch|revise|reject|post`,
  `browser-bridge up|down`, `host-agent up|down|status`, `framework-bugs list|clear`,
  `bootstrap` flags, `destroy [--purge]`, `start` claude-args). Closes #13.
- **`install.sh`** now runs `claudebox completion bash` and drops the output into
  `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/bash-completion/completions/<binname>` —
  the XDG-standard path bash-completion auto-loads. Prints a hint if bash-completion
  isn't detected (brew/port/system pkg paths checked). zsh users with `bashcompinit`
  loaded pick this up too; a native zsh completion is a separate ask.

Host-only (wrapper.sh + install.sh) — no image rebuild needed; reinstall the wrapper
to pick it up.

## [2.23.0] — 2026-07-19 _(fork)_

### Added
- **`cb-consult post <id> --author <name> [--status <state>]`** — the missing framework-
  Claude authoring verb. Replaces the direct-Write-tool + `sed`-edit-meta workaround the
  `framework-consult` skill has been using for framework replies. Body on stdin; adds a
  turn as the named author (so replies land as `NNN-framework.md` instead of
  `NNN-claudebot.md`); optionally flips `meta.status` in one call. Mirrors the host
  `claudebox consult post` verb name for consistency. SKILL.md updated with both
  in-container and host recipes. Closes #2.
- **`claudebox checkversion --all`** — cross-project image inventory. Existing
  `checkversion` shows wrapper vs cb-infra vs the current project's image; `--all`
  additionally enumerates every other `cb-*` project VM's image version, so drift is
  visible across the whole install. Read-only, same "never boots a VM" semantic as
  bare `checkversion`. Closes #6.

### Fixed
- **`browser-bridge up`: fresh window hash per bridge session** (not stable across
  reboot). Previously the 8-hex `window-hash` file was persisted across `down` /
  restart, so a Mac reboot → new Chrome launch reused the same hash. Now the hash is
  regenerated whenever the pids file is missing or points at dead processes (Mac
  reboot, VM restart, Chrome closed) — i.e. whenever we're actually launching a new
  Chrome. A second `up` while the bridge is still running reuses the current hash (so
  the printed identity matches the window that's actually open). Closes #3.

Host-only (wrapper.sh) + baked helper (cb-consult). **cb-consult change needs
`make build`**; the wrapper changes take effect on the next `install.sh` reinstall
without a rebuild.

## [2.22.0] — 2026-07-17 _(fork)_

### Added
- **`cb-harness-watch-consults`** — in-container mirror of host `claudebox consult
  watch`, scoped to framework-dev needs: blocks until any cross-project consult enters
  `awaiting-framework` (a new thread OR a fresh `cb-consult say` turn on an existing
  awaiting-framework thread) OR any new unreviewed framework-bug report appears. Prints
  what changed, exits. Run as a background task from a framework-dev session; the
  harness re-invokes on exit; handle the change; relaunch to keep watching. Closes the
  mid-session-alert gap that let gammaray's consult `2026-07-17T01-36-41-51cb139f` sit
  unnoticed for hours. Default poll 20s (arg or `$CLAUDEBOX_HARNESS_WATCH_INTERVAL`).
  **First application of the `cb-harness-<name>` convention** established in
  `docs/design/framework-dev-mode.md` (`c717031`). Also referenced from the
  `framework-consult` skill so future framework-Claude sessions launch it as a
  background task. Closes #7.

### Changed
- **Renamed `CLAUDEBOX_FRAMEWORK_DEV` → `CLAUDEBOX_HARNESS_DEV`** to match the
  `harness` naming convention established in 2.20.0 (`claudebox harness <verb>`,
  `cb-harness-<name>`, `cb_harness_<verb>`). Backward-compat: the legacy name is still
  honored as an alias — same pattern as `CLAUDE_* → CLAUDEBOX_*`. Fixes a latent
  inconsistency: the env override was honored in `entrypoint.sh` but NOT in
  `wrapper.sh`'s `cb_is_framework_dev`, so a renamed/relocated fork got startup
  surfacing but not the `claudebox harness` commands. Both now check the env, and
  `cb_is_framework_dev` is the single source of truth (called from both files).
- **New env-var naming convention** documented in
  `docs/design/framework-dev-mode.md` — `CLAUDEBOX_HARNESS_*` for framework-dev-mode
  env; `CLAUDEBOX_HARNESS_WATCH_INTERVAL` is the second in the family.

**Needs `make build`** (new baked helper + entrypoint change); rebuild auto-recreates
containers.

## [2.21.1] — 2026-07-17 _(fork)_

### Fixed
- **`cb-browser cdp` / `cb-browser script-cdp` fail on the second run of a session**
  with `browserType.connectOverCDP: Protocol error (Browser.setDownloadBehavior):
  Browser context management is not supported.` Root cause: Playwright's
  `connectOverCDP` falls through to a browser-level `Browser.setDownloadBehavior`
  call when the debug Chrome has zero page targets at attach time (stock Chrome
  rejects that API — it's a Playwright-owned-Chrome-only knob). And 2.17.0's
  `script-cdp` snapshot-diff cleanup guarantees zero page targets after any run
  whose script opened all its own tabs from an empty starting state. First run of
  a session works (welcome tab exists); subsequent runs fail until the human
  manually opens a tab. Fix: new `_cdp_ensure_page` helper in `cb-browser` —
  `PUT /json/new?about:blank` (with GET fallback for pre-v100 Chrome) when
  `/json/list` shows zero page targets, before Playwright attaches. Wired into
  both `script-cdp` (fires BEFORE the `_pre` snapshot so the warm-up tab is
  inside `_pre` and cleanup preserves it across runs — no accumulation) and
  `cdp` (fires before the `docker run` — no snapshot there to interact with).
  Diagnostic log if the warm-up itself fails so the failure mode is obvious
  instead of Playwright's cryptic error. Resolves gammaray consult
  `2026-07-17T01-36-41-51cb139f`. **Needs `make build`** (`cb-browser` +
  entrypoint guidance); rebuild auto-recreates containers.

## [2.21.0] — 2026-07-16 _(fork)_

### Added
- **`claudebox harness sync --repair`** — automatic recovery from BuildKit snapshotter
  corruption. That corruption (`failed to prepare extraction snapshot ... parent
  snapshot ... does not exist`) is rare-but-real (interrupted build, prune racing with
  a build, an upgrade across BuildKit versions); the manual recovery is always
  `docker builder prune -af` + retry, and now the harness wraps it. `--repair` runs
  `make build` as normal; if it succeeds, we're done. If it fails, the wrapper greps
  stderr for the specific corruption pattern — matches → auto-prunes cb-infra's build
  cache and retries once; no match → surfaces the error and exits (won't nuke the
  cache for unrelated failures like a Dockerfile syntax error or an apt-get network
  timeout). Concrete case that motivated this: Alan hit the corruption after four days
  of harness iteration and had to run the exact `builder prune -af` + retry sequence
  manually. Now it's one flag. Costs ~10-20 min extra for a cold-start rebuild when it
  fires — same cost as the manual recovery, just no keyboard mash. Host-only (wrapper)
  — **no image rebuild needed**; reinstall the wrapper to pick it up.

## [2.20.2] — 2026-07-16 _(fork)_

### Fixed
- **`cb-consult` `_post` numbering race.** Two concurrent writers on the same thread
  (e.g. framework-Claude posting a reply and the claudebot running `cb-consult
  resolve` in the same second) both computed the same "next" turn number from
  `find ... | wc -l` and produced e.g. `004-framework.md` + `004-claudebot.md`
  (different author suffixes, so no clobber — but breaks chronological ordering).
  Hit this twice in a single session working gammaray's consults; renamed to `005`
  manually both times. Fix: `_post` now serialises the count+write inside a
  per-thread `flock` on `<thread>/.post-lock`. Verified with 10 concurrent writers
  → sequential 001–010, zero collisions. **Needs `make build`** (baked helper);
  rebuild auto-recreates containers.

## [2.20.1] — 2026-07-16 _(fork)_

### Fixed
- **cb-infra BuildKit cache no longer grows unbounded across rebuilds.** The Makefile's
  `build` and `build-minimal` targets already ran `docker image prune -f` after each
  build to reclaim the previous `claudebox:latest` (now dangling after retag), but they
  did **not** prune BuildKit cache — so cache from every intermediate stage
  (`apt-get`/`npm i`/`pyenv install`/etc.) accumulated forever. Concrete: after four
  days of harness iteration (2.15.4 → 2.20.0, seven versions + interim experiments),
  Alan's cb-infra had **41 GB** of stale build cache, which only came out via a
  nuclear `docker builder prune -af` (which also wiped the useful cache and forced a
  ~10-20-min next-build cold-start). Fix: Makefile now also runs `docker builder prune
  -f` (non-`-a`, dangling cache only, so recently-used layers survive) after each
  build. Same shape as the existing `image prune -f`, and mirrors what 2.15.3 did for
  project VMs via `CLAUDEBOX_PRUNE_ON_START`. Repo-only (Makefile) — **no image
  rebuild needed**, no wrapper reinstall; the next `make build` picks up the new
  behavior.

## [2.20.0] — 2026-07-16 _(fork)_

### Added
- **`claudebox harness <verb>`** — a namespace for framework-dev-only commands, gated by
  the framework-dev fingerprint (workspace's `wrapper.sh` at root contains
  `CLAUDEBOX_VERSION=`). Listed in `--help` with a "framework-dev:" tag (same pattern as
  `host-agent`'s TRUSTED tag) so non-dev users see it, register it as not-for-them, and
  skip past. Running a `harness` verb from a non-harness workspace (e.g. from gammaray)
  errors clearly with "$root is not a claudebox harness fork" rather than doing something
  surprising. First verb:
  - **`claudebox harness sync`** — rebuild cb-infra's `claudebox:latest` from the current
    wrapper checkout (thin wrapper around `make build`). Correction side of the 2.19.0
    drift warning: once the wrapper tells you cb-infra is behind, this is the one command
    to bring it forward. In-container guard: refuses to run from inside a container
    (docker backend would build on the container's own VM, NOT cb-infra) and prints the
    exact Mac command to run instead.
- Refactor: extracted `cb_is_framework_dev` helper (was inlined in 2.19.0's
  `cb_check_infra_drift`); now shared by the drift check + the new `harness` gate.

Host-only (wrapper.sh) — **no image rebuild needed**; reinstall the wrapper to pick it up.

## [2.19.0] — 2026-07-16 _(fork)_

### Added
- **`claudebox` warns on every invocation when `cb-infra` image is behind the wrapper.**
  A latent gap the framework-dev-inside-a-claudebox workflow exposed: since 2.15.0's
  `CLAUDEBOX_BACKEND=docker` auto-detect, `make build` from inside a framework-dev
  claudebot builds on the project's own VM daemon — **not** on `cb-infra`. So while the
  wrapper's `CLAUDEBOX_VERSION` marches forward with each release, `cb-infra` keeps
  whatever version was there when it was last built from the Mac. Fresh project VMs
  reseed from `cb-infra` → they silently inherit the stale image. `claudebox
  checkversion` catches this if run explicitly, but drift accumulates invisibly
  otherwise. Concrete: six releases 2.15.4 → 2.18.0 shipped in one session with
  `cb-infra` untouched; other projects would have gotten the old image on next reseed.
  Now `claudebox` runs a fast cb-infra image inspect (silent if cb-infra is down or the
  image is unstamped) and prints a one-line severity-classified warning on drift:
  - 🔴 MAJOR — rebuild REQUIRED (breaking IPC-contract change)
  - 🟠 MINOR — SHOULD rebuild (additive contract change / new features)
  - 🟡 PATCH — rebuild optional (fixes/docs only)
  Auto-skipped for the framework-dev workspace itself (fingerprint: `wrapper.sh` at
  root containing `CLAUDEBOX_VERSION=` — the person iterating there IS the one causing
  drift). Silenceable via **`CLAUDEBOX_NO_DRIFT_WARN=1`** for scripted / CI contexts.
  Never blocks — always a warning; fires on the same allowlist as the workspace + new-
  project guards (skipped for `setup-token`, `-v`, `--version`, `doctor`, `auth`,
  `mcp`, `stop`, `clear-session`). Host-only (wrapper) — **no image rebuild needed**;
  reinstall the wrapper to pick it up.

## [2.18.0] — 2026-07-16 _(fork)_

### Added
- **CDP debug Chrome window is named "Claudebox Chrome -- `<hash>`".** `claudebox
  browser-bridge up` now launches Chrome with a data-URL welcome tab whose `<title>`
  is `"Claudebox Chrome -- <hash>"` (8-hex-digit instance hash from `/dev/urandom`,
  persisted to `~/.config/claudebox/cdp/window-hash` so a subsequent `up` reuses the
  same hash; wiped by `down` so the next `up` gets a fresh one). macOS Chrome's window
  title mirrors the active tab's title, so the debug window is now identifiable at a
  glance in Mission Control / Cmd+Tab / Dock tooltip — no more "which of these Chrome
  windows is claudebot's?". The welcome message also prints the full window title so
  you can grep for it. Tradeoff (documented): if you navigate the welcome tab, the
  title changes with it — reopen the welcome URL (or the tab) to get the marker back.
  `--app`-mode was rejected as an alternative because it strips the tab strip / URL bar
  / DevTools, which defeats the point of interactive debugging.

Host-only (wrapper.sh) — **no image rebuild needed**; reinstall the wrapper (`install.sh`)
to pick it up.

## [2.17.1] — 2026-07-16 _(fork)_

### Fixed
- **Claudebot never prompts for permission again.** The runtime flag
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions` is passed on every `claude` invocation, but it isn't
  fully authoritative in newer Claude Code — certain operations (notably writes under
  `~/.claude/`) still surface a permission prompt. Concrete case: a gammaray session
  paused mid-work to ask for `mkdir -p ~/.claude/bin`. The claudebox model is that the
  container **is** the sandbox — Claude should never prompt inside it. Fix: the entrypoint
  now also persists `.permissions.defaultMode = "bypassPermissions"` into
  `~/.claude/settings.json` on every container start (jq-merge if the file exists, seed if
  it doesn't). This makes bypass mode the *persistent* default alongside the runtime flag,
  and self-heals if an accidental UI toggle changes it — the next boot rewrites it.
  **Needs `make build`** (entrypoint change); rebuild auto-recreates existing containers.

## [2.17.0] — 2026-07-16 _(fork)_

### Added
- **`cb-browser script-cdp <file.cjs>`** — Approach-B's `script`: a dedicated CDP-aware
  subcommand for custom Playwright flows against the human's real Chrome. Resolves
  gammaray consult `2026-07-16T15-12-59-51cb139f` (CDP tab-lifecycle standard) and
  closes an untriaged framework gap: `cb-browser script` is A-only (cb-net, headless,
  no CDP env forwarded), but the docs implicitly recommended it for custom CDP flows —
  which meant claudebots either rolled their own `docker run -e CLAUDEBOX_HOST_CDP_URL
  --network host …` (defeating the point of `cb-*` helpers) or hit an obscure
  connection failure. `script-cdp` closes that gap end-to-end:
  - Requires the CDP bridge (`claudebox browser-bridge up`); errors clearly if down.
  - Forwards `CLAUDEBOX_HOST_CDP_URL` (both under its full name and as `$CDP_URL`) plus
    `CLAUDEBOX_VM_IP`; uses `--network host` so the container reaches
    `192.168.64.1:9223` over `col0`.
  - **Tab-leak safety net.** Snapshots page targets on the debug Chrome via
    `/json/list` before the script runs; on exit (any status, incl. `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`)
    closes any *new* page targets whose ids weren't in the pre-snapshot. So the
    natural Playwright pattern (`connectOverCDP → newPage → browser.close`) can't
    leak tabs — `browser.close()` alone only detaches CDP, the tab lives on until an
    explicit `page.close()`. Filter is `type === "page"`, so service workers,
    iframes, background pages, and workers are never touched. Opt-out:
    **`CB_BROWSER_CDP_KEEP=1`** (env — a flag would collide with pass-through
    `args...`).
  - **Assumption (baked into the design):** the debug Chrome is a dedicated profile
    (per `docs/design/browser-testing.md` § "B security"), so the human isn't doing
    casual browsing there. A tab the human opens in the debug profile mid-run is
    included in "opened during the run" and will be closed on cleanup — this is
    acceptable because that's precisely what "dedicated" means.
- **`docs/design/browser-testing.md`** gains a new "Custom CDP flows:
  `cb-browser script-cdp`" subsection under Approach B (canonical `try/finally` +
  `page.close` snippet, the `$CLAUDEBOX_VM_IP:<port>` addressing pattern for hitting
  in-VM workloads from a host-networked container, and the opt-out). The A1 section
  now explicitly marks `cb-browser script` as A-only. The "Prefer `cb-browser cdp` /
  `script-cdp` over a hand-rolled `connectOverCDP`" paragraph now warns against
  reproducing `connectOverCDP` under `cb-browser script`. Phased-plan gains item 6.
- **Baked container guidance** (`entrypoint.sh`) gains a "Custom CDP script? Use
  `cb-browser script-cdp`, NOT `cb-browser script`" bullet under CDP gotchas, and the
  A1 `script` bullet is marked A-only with a pointer to `script-cdp`.
- **`docs/environment-variables.md`** gains a "Container-side `cb-browser` knobs"
  section documenting `CB_BROWSER_*` (previously undocumented — the whole family) and
  the new `CB_BROWSER_CDP_KEEP`.

No new sidecar files, no new host↔container env-forwarding schema, no marker — pure
additive baked-helper surface + docs. **Needs `make build`** (`cb-browser` +
entrypoint changes); rebuild auto-recreates existing containers.

## [2.16.1] — 2026-07-16 _(fork)_

### Changed
- **Baked guidance now leads with a framework-vs-project check.** New section in
  `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (generated by `entrypoint.sh` on every container start), placed
  immediately before the two escalation channels ("Reporting a bug in the claudebox
  FRAMEWORK" and "Escalating a framework BEST-PRACTICE question"), that asks a claudebot
  at write-time: does the rule I'm about to write name any code/schema/service that
  belongs to *this* project? If no, it's a framework rule and belongs upstream via
  `cb-report-bug` (concrete defect / doc gap) or `cb-consult open` (best-practice
  question) — not in the project's own `CLAUDE.md`. Signals + keyword list demoted to
  illustration (the positive test is authoritative so it doesn't rot as new `cb-*`
  helpers get added). Resolves gammaray consult `2026-07-16T15-12-41-51cb139f`; the
  triggering incident was a page-close-in-finally rule that mislabeled a framework
  concern (`cb-browser script` CDP tab lifecycle) as a project rule and would never have
  propagated. Companion doc pointers added to `docs/design/framework-consult.md` and
  `docs/design/framework-bug-reporting.md`. **Needs `make build`** (entrypoint change);
  rebuild auto-recreates existing containers.

## [2.16.0] — 2026-07-16 _(fork)_

### Added — framework-Claude in-container review surface
- **Startup surfacing for framework-dev claudebots.** A claudebot developing the harness
  itself from *inside* a container had no visibility onto framework-bug reports or consults
  that OTHER projects had filed and were awaiting a framework draft — the review flow was
  designed assuming framework-Claude worked on the Mac via `claudebox consult list` /
  `claudebox framework-bugs list`, but those are host wrapper commands and not reachable
  from inside a container. Concrete miss: a session working on this repo had no idea
  gammaray had filed 2 consults + 1 bug earlier the same day. Now the entrypoint detects
  when the workspace **is** a claudebox harness fork (`wrapper.sh` at its root containing
  `CLAUDEBOX_VERSION=` — a very specific fingerprint; override with
  **`CLAUDEBOX_FRAMEWORK_DEV=1`**) and injects a startup note listing every consult with
  `status=awaiting-framework` (across ALL projects) plus every framework-bug report not
  yet marked `.reviewed`, pointing at the two new in-container commands below. Skipped for
  every normal claudebot.
- **`cb-consult list --all`** — cross-project consult listing (framework-dev view). The
  default `cb-consult list` still filters to this project's threads only; `--all` widens
  it to every project and includes the project id column, matching what host
  `claudebox consult list` shows.
- **`cb-report-bug list|show|done`** — the missing management surface for the
  file-drop bug reports. `list` prints every bug in the shared drop dir (marking those
  with a `.reviewed` sidecar `✓`); `show <slug>` prints the report body; `done <slug>`
  drops a `.reviewed` sidecar so the framework-dev startup surfacing hides it from the
  "unreviewed" count. The historic filing form (`cb-report-bug "<title>" ... <<EOF`) is
  unchanged — subcommands are only recognized as the FIRST arg.

Together these mean a framework-dev claudebot working on this repo (or any renamed fork)
picks up waiting review work on every session start, instead of only when a human tells
it. Env-var + doc updated. **Needs `make build`** (entrypoint + baked helpers); the
rebuild auto-recreates existing containers.

## [2.15.4] — 2026-07-15 _(fork)_

### Added
- **Guard against silently spinning up a fresh project in some random dir.** Running
  `claudebox` in a dir without `.claudebox/config.yml` used to silently create the
  config (and, on the next step, a per-project Colima VM that reserves CPU/RAM/disk
  and takes ~30-60s to boot) — trivially triggered by a mistyped `cd`, a wrong
  terminal, or a scratch dir. Now the wrapper detects it and prompts
  (`Create a new claudebox project at this path? [y/N]`), suggesting
  `claudebox bootstrap "<intent>"` as the proper way to start a new project. In
  non-interactive mode it aborts (safer for CI/scripts). Override with
  **`CLAUDEBOX_ALLOW_NEW=1`**. Follows the 2.5.1 subdir-guard pattern; skipped for the
  same allowlist of throwaway/utility commands (`setup-token`, `-v`, `--version`,
  `doctor`, `auth`, `mcp`, `stop`, `clear-session`). `bootstrap` self-heals via its
  re-exec (creates `.claudebox/` first, then re-enters). Host-only — **no image
  rebuild needed**; reinstall the wrapper to pick it up.

## [2.15.3] — 2026-07-13 _(fork)_

### Changed
- **`CLAUDEBOX_PRUNE_ON_START` now also prunes dangling images**, not just build cache. The
  opt-in prune ran `docker builder prune -f` only, so an untagged image orphaned when a
  rebuild retagged `claudebox:latest` (routine on harness-dev projects that `make build`
  often) would linger — one such image on the dev VM was ~1.7 GB of unique layers, invisible
  to `docker images` and only visible via `docker system df`'s "reclaimable". Now the same
  opt-in also runs `docker image prune -f` alongside. Best-effort and safe — `image prune -f`
  only touches untagged unreferenced images (never a tagged image, never a running
  container's image). Env-var + doc updated. `vm gc` (Mac-side) has always covered this;
  this closes the same gap on the container side. **Needs `make build`** (entrypoint change).

## [2.15.2] — 2026-07-12 _(fork)_

### Changed
- **Dockerfile layer caching — releases and script edits no longer rebuild the toolchain.**
  `full` is `FROM base`, so the two frequently-changing things that lived in `base` — the
  `CLAUDEBOX_VERSION` ARG/ENV/LABEL (near the top, bumped every release) and the harness
  `COPY`s + `CHANGELOG.md` (at the end of base, change nearly every commit) — invalidated
  full's entire Go/npm/pyenv/pip toolchain on every build, making a version bump or a one-line
  script edit a ~10–20 min rebuild. Moved both into a cheap `harness` staging stage that each
  variant `COPY --from`'s in — with the version stamp — at the very END, after the toolchain.
  Now a release rebuilds only the tail ENV/LABEL and a script/CHANGELOG edit only the three
  final `COPY --from=harness` layers; the toolchain stays cached (verified on cb-infra: 0 npm
  reruns). **Build-time only** — the resulting image is behaviorally identical, so existing
  users need **no rebuild**. One-time cost: the next `make build` re-establishes `base`'s layers.

## [2.15.1] — 2026-07-13 _(fork)_

### Fixed
- **`CLAUDEBOX_VM_IP` was empty on first-run cold boot.** The wrapper's IP-injection block
  ran BEFORE `cb_ensure_vm`, so on a brand-new VM the lookup raced `colima start
  --network-address` (col0 reachability lags by a couple of seconds) — the env never got
  set, the sidecar was written empty, and the fresh container came up without the address
  its browser tier / CORS logic needs. Only self-healed on the NEXT `claudebox` run once
  the VM was already up. Fixed by moving the injection into `cb_ensure_vm` itself (new
  `cb_inject_vm_env` helper) and switching to `cb_wait_reachable` so col0's boot lag is
  handled. Host-only — no image rebuild, no IPC contract change (sidecar name/format and
  env-var names unchanged).

## [2.15.0] — 2026-07-12 _(fork)_

### Added
- **Backend-aware build + test (`CLAUDEBOX_BACKEND`)** — task #15 Approach 2 **phase 3**, resolved
  as "docker LOCAL, not proxied." A `docker` shim proxying to the Mac was rejected (near-full host
  compromise — `docker run -v /:/mac` on the Mac — for little gain). Instead `make build` and
  `tests/common.sh` now branch on `CLAUDEBOX_BACKEND` (`colima` | `docker`, auto-`docker` when
  `/.dockerenv` exists): in `docker` mode they build the image and run the integration tests on the
  **ambient daemon** (the dev claudebot's own VM), with no colima and no host proxy. So a claudebot
  developing this harness inside a container can `make build` + `bash test.sh` end-to-end. The
  phase-1 `host-agent` remains only for the narrow slice that needs *real* Colima (e.g. exercising
  `claudebox vm gc` against live VMs). Override: `make build CLAUDEBOX_BACKEND=docker`,
  `CLAUDEBOX_BACKEND=docker bash test.sh`. Design: [docs/design/backends.md](docs/design/backends.md).

Repo-only (Makefile / test harness) — **no image rebuild needed**.

## [2.14.0] — 2026-07-12 _(fork)_

### Added
- **`claudebox host-agent` — proxy the framework's host commands to the Mac** (backlog #15,
  Approach 2, **phase 1**). Lets a claudebot developing *this harness* inside a container run the
  framework's `colima`/`limactl` calls against the real Mac Colima, so the full orchestration is
  under test from a container. How it works:
  - **`host-agent.py`** — a small Mac daemon (reusing the CDP-bridge gateway pattern) that runs an
    **allowlisted** `colima`/`limactl` (binary **and** subcommand). **Security: opt-in, off by
    default; binds only the Colima gateway `192.168.64.1` (never LAN); per-session bearer token;
    subcommand-allowlisted.** It is a **trusted single-operator tool**, not a general claudebot
    capability. `claudebox host-agent up|down|status`.
  - **`cb-host-shim`** baked as `colima` + `limactl` on the container PATH — proxies each call to
    the agent. The wrapper injects the agent URL+token via a durable `-hostagent` sidecar (empty
    when the agent is down → entrypoint unsets it).
  - Proven end-to-end: a bridge-network container ran real `colima list` on the Mac (no
    `--network host` needed); the allowlist denied a non-`colima`/`limactl` command.
  - Design + phasing + full security model: [docs/design/backends.md](docs/design/backends.md).
    Not yet done: the `docker` shim (phase 3) that would make `make build`/`test.sh` fully proxy.
- `install.sh` installs `host-agent.py` next to the wrapper.

**Needs `make build`** (Dockerfile + entrypoint); rebuild auto-recreates containers.

## [2.13.0] — 2026-07-12 _(fork)_

### Added
- **`claudebox bootstrap --workspace` — first-class multi-repo projects** (backlog #13). One
  project / one VM / N repos as siblings. `--workspace` (alias `--multi-repo`) makes the
  current dir an **orchestration parent** (git init + README, but **no** `workloads/`), writes
  a multi-repo-framed BRIEF, and seeds a `.gitignore` excluding the sibling repo dirs +
  machine-local `config.yml`/`secrets.env` — so the parent never tracks the app repos as
  gitlinks (the footgun). Repeatable **`--repo <url>`** (URL or `gh owner/repo`, implies
  `--workspace`) clones each as a gitignored sibling using the host's git/`gh` auth.
  `--workspace` and `--adopt` are mutually exclusive. Docs:
  [multi-repo-projects.md](docs/design/multi-repo-projects.md).
- Internally, the bootstrap "flavor" (`adopt` | `workspace` | greenfield) now drives
  scaffolding + BRIEF framing uniformly.

Host-only (wrapper) — **no image rebuild needed**; reinstall the wrapper to pick it up.

## [2.12.0] — 2026-07-12 _(fork)_

### Added
- **`claudebox bootstrap --adopt` — adopt an EXISTING repo without the nested-repo tangle**
  (backlog #12). Plain `bootstrap` scaffolds a greenfield project (git init, README,
  `workloads/`); doing that to an existing repo is wrong, and cloning a repo *inside* the
  workspace produces the nesting mess gammaray hit. Now:
  - `bootstrap --adopt` adopts the repo already in `$PWD` — and bootstrap **auto-detects**
    this (an existing `.git` ⇒ adopt), **skipping** greenfield scaffolding so it never
    pollutes the repo, and framing the BRIEF as "this repo IS your workspace, extend it in
    place, don't re-clone it."
  - `bootstrap --adopt <url>` clones `<url>` (URL or `gh owner/repo`) **into the current
    empty dir first** (repo becomes the workspace root), then adopts. Refuses a non-empty
    dir. Uses the host's git/`gh` auth.
  - Adopting nudges you to seed `--gh-token` for private repos (git push/pull + the
    embedded-email `origin` gotcha).
  - Docs: [bootstrap.md](docs/design/bootstrap.md) (also refreshed the stale first-run
    surfacing section to the user-memory mechanism).

Host-only (wrapper) — **no image rebuild needed**; reinstall the wrapper to pick it up.

## [2.11.0] — 2026-07-12 _(fork)_

### Added — disk-management follow-ups (deferred from the disk consult)
- **Startup disk MOTD** — when the VM's `/` is ≥85% full at container boot, the entrypoint
  injects a disk warning into the claudebot's context, so a claudebot inheriting a near-full
  VM is told up front (with the prune commands + the Write-tool report escape).
- **`CLAUDEBOX_PRUNE_ON_START=1`** — opt-in: the entrypoint runs `docker builder prune -f`
  (build cache only, best-effort) on every start. Never removes tagged images; default off.
- **`CLAUDEBOX_TMPFS_TMP=<size>`** — opt-in: RAM-back the claudebot's `/tmp` (`--tmpfs`) so
  docker disk bloat can't starve the Bash tool at all. The hardest isolation; for chronically
  disk-tight projects.
- **Default `vm.disk` 60 → 100 GiB** for new projects (sparse, so near-zero Mac cost).

### Changed
- **Trimmed the baked framework guidance** ~284 → ~223 lines: the exhaustive per-language tool
  inventory is condensed to a short "what's baked" summary + "discover with `which`/`cb-help`/
  profiles", improving adherence (closer to the ~200-line guideline). Directive guidance
  (networking, disk, secrets, consult, etc.) is unchanged.

Docs: [disk-management.md](docs/design/disk-management.md), [environment-variables.md](docs/environment-variables.md).

**Needs `make build`** (entrypoint change); rebuild auto-recreates containers.

## [2.10.0] — 2026-07-12 _(fork)_

### Changed
- **Framework guidance now reaches EVERY claudebot — via `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (user memory),
  rewritten every start.** Previously the guidance was copied into the workspace `./CLAUDE.md`
  once, and only if the project didn't already have one — so **existing-repo projects got
  nothing**, and the copy never refreshed on harness updates (the task #10 gap). Now the
  entrypoint writes the guidance to the container's user-memory file on every boot. Claude Code
  loads `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` additively with (and below) the project's own `./CLAUDE.md`, in
  every mode incl. `-p` / `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, so:
  - existing-repo projects (with their own `./CLAUDE.md`) now get the guidance too, untouched;
  - the guidance is always current (a reseed carries the latest);
  - the project's `./CLAUDE.md` is never written to or mixed with framework text.
- **Greenfield projects no longer get a seeded workspace `./CLAUDE.md`** — the guidance lives in
  user memory; the project creates its own `CLAUDE.md` (via `/init` or as it develops) when it
  has project-specific conventions.
- The bootstrap **mission banner** (`.claudebox/BRIEF.md`) is now surfaced *in the user-memory
  file* (conditional on the brief existing), not prepended to the workspace `CLAUDE.md`.
- Design + precedence/migration notes: [docs/design/framework-guidance.md](docs/design/framework-guidance.md).
  Follow-up: the generated file is ~280 lines — trimming toward directive essentials (letting
  `cb-help`/discovery cover the tool inventory) is worthwhile.

**Needs `make build`** (entrypoint change); the rebuild auto-recreates containers, and existing
projects pick up the guidance on their next reseed — no per-project migration needed.

## [2.9.2] — 2026-07-12 _(fork)_

### Fixed
- **Consult `watch` no longer self-triggers.** Both watchers used to wake on *any* thread
  change, so framework-Claude posting a draft/approval immediately re-triggered its own
  watcher (and a claudebot's own `open`/`say`/`resolve` re-triggered its). Each watcher now
  wakes only on transitions **it** can act on: `claudebox consult watch` (host) on a thread
  *entering* `awaiting-framework` (a new consult, or a claudebot `say`/`revise`);
  `cb-consult watch` (container) on a reply *landing* (`awaiting-claudebot`). Implemented by
  tracking only the actionable subset and firing on additions. Host side (`wrapper.sh`) is
  live on reinstall; the container side (`cb-consult`) ships on the next `make build`.

## [2.9.1] — 2026-07-12 _(fork)_

### Fixed
- **`claudebox vm gc` data-loss bug — it deleted STOPPED VMs' disks.** The orphan detection
  keyed on `limactl disk ls`'s `IN-USE-BY` column (`awk NF<5`), which is blank for any VM
  that isn't *running* — so gc treated every stopped VM's disk as junk and deleted it
  (observed: it removed the `cb-9f96a052` project VM's disk, and would have deleted the
  `cb-infra` **image store** the moment it was stopped). Fixed to cross-reference disk names
  against the known colima **profiles** (which include Stopped ones); a disk is orphaned only
  if no profile owns it. `claudebox vm usage` had the same misclassification — also fixed, and
  it now measures stopped VMs' disks by name. Host-only (wrapper) — **no image rebuild needed**;
  reinstall the wrapper (`install.sh`) to pick it up.

## [2.9.0] — 2026-07-12 _(fork)_

### Added
- **Docker disk-management standard** (produced via the consult channel — the disk issue a
  claudebot hit + escalated). A project's Colima VM has ONE overlay disk shared by docker
  (images + BuildKit build cache) AND the claudebot's `/tmp`; when docker bloat fills it, the
  Claude Code Bash tool dies with `ENOSPC` and every command fails — including the report
  tools. New:
  - **`docs/design/disk-management.md`** — the standard: one-disk-two-tenants model, prune
    discipline, budget rule, symptom→cause→fix table, and the **Write-tool escape** (when Bash
    is dead, the claudebot writes a report file directly into the mounted `framework-bugs`/
    `framework-consult` dir — no shell needed).
  - **`cb-df`** — new baked helper: `df -h /` + `docker system df` + biggest images, with a
    ≥85%-full warning. cb-* convention, cb-help-discoverable.
  - **Baked "Disk discipline" guidance** in the container `CLAUDE.md` (prune cadence, `cb-df`,
    the ENOSPC→Write-tool escape).

### Fixed
- **`claudebox vm gc` now prunes BuildKit build cache**, not just dangling images. Build cache
  is the real accumulator on image-iterating projects, and `image prune` never touches it — so
  `vm gc` was leaving the biggest reclaimable chunk on the disk.

**Needs `make build`** (entrypoint + new `cb-df` helper); rebuild auto-recreates containers.

## [2.8.1] — 2026-07-11 _(fork)_

### Changed
- **Consult alerting, claudebot half of Idea A.** Baked container guidance now tells a
  claudebot to launch `cb-consult watch` as a background task **right after it opens a
  consult** (targeted — only while it's actually waiting on a reply, not a blanket
  poller), so it's alerted the moment an approved reply lands instead of polling. If its
  session ends first, startup surfacing catches the reply next boot. Complements the
  framework-side `SessionStart` hook added just before. Baked-`CLAUDE.md` change → reaches
  **new** projects on build; existing projects pick it up when their `CLAUDE.md.template`
  is regenerated (the task-#10 propagation limitation).

**Needs `make build`** (entrypoint guidance); rebuild auto-recreates containers.

## [2.8.0] — 2026-07-11 _(fork)_

### Added
- **Consult alerting — surfacing + `watch`.** So a claudebot and framework-Claude aren't
  unaware of incoming replies/state changes:
  - **(A) Startup surfacing:** the entrypoint now injects a note into the **claudebot's**
    startup context when one of its consults is `awaiting-claudebot` (an approved reply is
    waiting) — mirroring the host wrapper already surfacing pending consults to the human.
  - **(B) `watch`:** new `claudebox consult watch` (host) and `cb-consult watch` (container)
    — **token-free** loops that block until a relevant thread changes state (new consult /
    reply landing / new turn), print what changed, and exit. Run as a background task in a
    live session; the harness re-invokes on exit → handle → relaunch. Pure files + polling
    (default 20s, `watch [secs]`); no external infra. The `framework-consult` skill uses it.
- Sequence diagram (Mermaid) + a "Staying alerted" section in
  [docs/design/framework-consult.md](docs/design/framework-consult.md).

**Needs `make build`** (entrypoint + `cb-consult` changes); the rebuild auto-recreates
existing containers on next run.

## [2.7.0] — 2026-07-08 _(fork)_

### Added
- **Framework consult — supervised claudebot ↔ framework-Claude collaboration.** A
  claudebot can escalate a *general* framework/environment problem (one that would recur
  in any claudebox project) to framework-Claude working on the harness, gated by the
  human, so the resolution becomes a **baked-in standard** instead of a per-project
  reinvention. Peer-to-peer via a shared file substrate (mounted at
  `/home/claude/framework-consult`, `CLAUDEBOX_CONSULT_DIR`); the only sub-agent is the
  Agent-tool **drafting sub-agent** framework-Claude spawns — the app-building claudebot
  is never a sub-agent. Nothing reaches the claudebot until the human approves.
  - New container helper **`cb-consult`** (`open`/`say`/`read`/`list`/`resolve`).
  - New host verb **`claudebox consult`** (`list`/`show`/`approve`/`revise`/`reject`/`post`);
    a normal `claudebox` run surfaces consults awaiting your approval or a framework draft.
  - New **`framework-consult` skill** drives the hybrid auto-draft loop (draft with a
    sub-agent → your approval → apply + reply with the commit hash).
  - Design: [docs/design/framework-consult.md](docs/design/framework-consult.md).
- **`docs/design/n-tier-networking.md` — the first standard this channel produced.** The
  N-tier addressing/binding/CORS standard (service-name vs the rotating VM IP, bind
  `0.0.0.0`, drive CORS/`allowedDevOrigins` from `$CLAUDEBOX_VM_IP`), with Next/Express/
  FastAPI snippets, a worked Next+API+postgres layout, and a symptom→cause→fix table. A
  concise version is baked into the container `CLAUDE.md`.
- **`CLAUDEBOX_HOSTNAME`** injected into the container when `network.hostname` is set —
  the rotation-proof stable alias for the VM IP (rides the `-vmip` sidecar).

**Needs `make build`** (entrypoint + new `cb-consult` helper); the rebuild auto-recreates
existing containers on next run.

## [2.6.0] — 2026-07-08 _(fork)_

### Added
- **`CLAUDEBOX_VM_IP` — the claudebot now knows its VM's reachable IP.** The container
  sits on the VM's docker bridge (`172.x`) and cannot self-discover the reachable
  `192.168.64.x` (col0) address — the *only* address the human's Mac (and its Chrome,
  over CDP) can reach a published workload at. The wrapper now injects the current IP as
  `CLAUDEBOX_VM_IP`, both via `docker run -e` and via a durable `-vmip` sidecar refreshed
  every run — so it survives `docker start` **and self-heals when the IP rotates across
  VM restarts** (a real failure here: `.13` → `.16` left a stale IP baked in
  `next.config.ts`). New helpers: `cb-browser ip` (in-container) and `claudebox ip`
  (host, bare scriptable IP; `claudebox net` keeps the full dashboard).

### Fixed / Changed
- **`cb-browser cdp` auto-rewrites `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`/`0.0.0.0` targets to the VM
  IP** (with a printed note) instead of silently failing — the Mac's Chrome can't reach
  a VM workload via localhost, and rediscovering that burned real cycles.
- **Baked container guidance rewritten** for the VM-IP reachability model: the VM IP is
  THE address for Mac/Chrome to reach workloads; it **rotates** so never hardcode it
  (read `$CLAUDEBOX_VM_IP`/`cb-browser ip` fresh — not in `allowedDevOrigins`,
  `server.allowedHosts`, CORS, `.env`, or test URLs); `localhost` demoted to a fragile,
  collision-prone fallback; and prefer `cb-browser cdp`/`script` over a hand-rolled
  `connectOverCDP` (which can trip on `Browser.setDownloadBehavior` vs a stock Chrome).
- Docs: [docs/design/browser-testing.md](docs/design/browser-testing.md) gains a CDP
  reachability + rotating-VM-IP tips section.

**Needs `make build`** (entrypoint change); the rebuild auto-recreates existing
containers on next run.

## [2.5.2] — 2026-07-07 _(fork)_

### Fixed
- **`browser-bridge up` now reaches an already-running claudebot.** The CDP bridge URL
  (`CLAUDEBOX_HOST_CDP_URL`) was injected **only** via `docker run -e`, so it never
  landed in a container that already existed — a restart is `docker start`, which can't
  add env, and there was no durable fallback (unlike auth/secrets). Bringing a bridge up
  had no effect until the container was recreated. Now the wrapper also writes the URL
  to a durable `.<container>-cdp` sidecar (empty when the bridge is down) that the
  entrypoint re-reads on every start — so `browser-bridge up`/`down` take effect on the
  next plain `claudebox` run, no recreation needed. The sidecar is a derived mirror of
  the marker (rewritten each invocation, self-heals to empty, removed by `destroy
  --purge`) — see [docs/design/browser-testing.md](docs/design/browser-testing.md).
  **Needs `make build`** (entrypoint change); the rebuild auto-recreates existing
  containers on next run.

## [2.5.1] — 2026-07-07 _(fork)_

### Fixed
- **Guard against running claudebot from inside `.claudebox`.** `cd`-ing into the
  metadata dir and running `claudebox` used to silently create a *stray* container that
  mounts `.claudebox` as the workspace (the VM/identity were still correct — the root is
  the git toplevel). Now the wrapper detects it, warns with the right `cd <project-root>`
  hint, and prompts (interactive) or aborts (non-interactive; override with
  `CLAUDEBOX_ALLOW_SUBDIR=1`). Host-only — no `make build` needed.

## [2.5.0] — 2026-07-07 _(fork)_

### Added
- **`CLAUDEBOX_NO_API_KEY=1`** — never send an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` into the container,
  even if one is exported on the Mac, so a claudebot uses your **Claude subscription**
  (browser OAuth / `claudebox setup-token`) instead of pay-per-token API billing. The
  wrapper drops the key; the entrypoint now **unsets** an empty auth value (rather than
  skipping it), so a key baked into an already-created container's env at `docker run`
  time is cleared too — the switch works on existing containers, not just fresh ones.

## [2.4.0] — 2026-07-07 _(fork)_

### Added
- **Profile system** — opt-in tool bundles per project. Declare `profiles: [typescript,
  python, go]` in `.claudebox/config.yml`; the entrypoint installs each matching baked
  installer (`/usr/local/lib/claudebox/profiles/<name>.sh`) once on first enable
  (marker-guarded, retries on offline failure), as the `claude` user. Ships
  `typescript` / `python` / `go` profiles (enable the respective `*-lsp` plugin; servers
  are baked). `claudebox profiles` lists enabled + available; `init.d/*.sh` stays the
  escape hatch. Policy — bake small/common LSP binaries, install heavy/niche per profile;
  the profile hides which. See [docs/design/profiles.md](docs/design/profiles.md).

## [2.3.0] — 2026-07-07 _(fork)_

### Added / Fixed
- **Bake the common LSP servers** into the full image so their Claude Code `*-lsp`
  plugins work — the plugins ship **no binary** (just a README descriptor), so they
  were silently non-functional without the server on PATH. Added
  **`typescript-language-server`** (TS/JS) and **`pyright`** (Python), joining the
  already-baked **`gopls`** (Go). Policy: small, common language servers are baked
  universally; heavy/niche ones stay per-profile (see task #14). Fixes the
  `examples/todo-app` TS-LSP hook, which installed the plugin but not its server.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-07-06 _(fork)_

Container-side convenience: a discoverable helper convention + an inside-the-container
`/claudebox` skill. **Requires `make build`** (image changes) to reach a claudebot.

### Added
- **`cb-*` convenience-command convention** — helpers the claudebot runs *inside* the
  container are named `cb-<name>`, carry a `# summary:` header, and are discovered by
  the new **`cb-help`** (baked). Baked helpers live in `/usr/local/bin`; per-project
  ones in `~/.claude/bin` (on PATH). `cb-browser` / `cb-report-bug` gained summaries.
  See [docs/design/convenience-scripts.md](docs/design/convenience-scripts.md).
- **Container-side `/claudebox` skill** — seeded into the claudebot by the entrypoint
  (rewritten each start so it stays current). A harness self-report from *inside*:
  version (`$CLAUDEBOX_VERSION`), `cb-help`, `~/CHANGELOG.md`, and the workspace/`cb-net`
  environment. (Distinct from the host `/claudebox` skill, which runs `claudebox info`.)
- The baked `CLAUDE.md` now tells the claudebot about `cb-help` and the `cb-*` convention.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-07-06 _(fork)_

Operability release — the day-to-day human/agent tooling on top of 2.0.0's core.

### Added
- **`claudebox info`** (alias `status`) — human at-a-glance dashboard: versions
  (wrapper / cb-infra / project image), the paths that matter (config.yml,
  secrets.env, per-project data dir), VM + container status, and network (VM IP,
  hostname, cb-net).
- **`/claudebox` Claude Code skill** — runs `claudebox info` from any project;
  shipped in the repo (`skills/`) and installed to `~/.claude/skills/` by
  `install.sh` (skip with `CLAUDEBOX_SKIP_SKILL=1`).
- **`CLAUDEBOX_CAFFEINATE=1`** — opt-in; keeps the Mac awake for the duration of a
  foreground claudebox session (interactive / programmatic) via `caffeinate -w $$`,
  so a long claudebot run doesn't stall when the machine sleeps and Colima suspends.
- **`claudebox destroy --purge`** — also delete the project's host data dir (session
  history, `--continue`, auth/secrets sidecars, settings) for a clean slate.
- **`claudebox vm usage` / `vm gc`** — per-VM disk footprint, and reclaim
  (orphaned-disk prune + **dangling (old) image prune** + `fstrim` of running cb-*
  VMs). `make build` also prunes the image it just superseded, so repeated builds
  don't pile up `<none>` images in cb-infra. `vm destroy` reaps the lima datadisk
  `colima delete` leaks.
- **`claudebox checkversion` severity** — classifies drift as MAJOR (must rebuild) /
  MINOR (should) / PATCH (optional).
- **Auto image propagation** — a rebuilt image auto-reseeds into a running project VM
  and the container is recreated on it (no manual `rmi`); session state preserved.
- **git identity fallback** — uses the host's `git config` when `CLAUDEBOX_GIT_*`
  are unset, so a fresh claudebot can always commit.
- **`network.hostname` discoverability** — `ip`/`net` and the generated config now
  suggest a friendly name, and **`claudebox net <hostname>`** sets it directly (no
  hand-editing YAML) then prints the `/etc/hosts` line.
- **`claudebox --help`** (`-h`) — a top-level usage summary of all commands + key env.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-07-06 _(fork)_

First versioned release of this fork. It opens the fork's own `2.x` line — chosen to
sit above upstream's `1.x` (highest pre-fork tag `v1.11.0`) so versions/tags never
collide and order coherently across the shared lineage. Changes from the upstream
fork point through `2.0.0` are **not itemized here** (they predate this policy — see
the git history / the README); from `2.0.0` on, every version bump gets an entry.

### Added
- **Semantic versioning** for the host↔image contract: a `VERSION` file +
  `CLAUDEBOX_VERSION` in `wrapper.sh` (kept in sync by a test) + an image stamp
  (`LABEL org.claudebox.version`). `claudebox version` prints the wrapper's semver;
  `claudebox checkversion` compares it against the claudebot image and warns on
  drift. See [docs/versioning.md](docs/versioning.md).

## [v1.11.0] — 2026-04-30

### Added
- **Telegram per-chat overrides** stored in `~/.claude/telegram_overrides.json`, persisting across bot restarts and trumping the YAML config:
  - `/model` — inline keyboard or `/model <name>`; choices: `haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus`, `opusplan`, `reset`.
  - `/effort` — same UX; choices: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`, `reset` (verified against the official Claude CLI docs).
  - `/system_prompt [text|reset]` — show/set/clear system-prompt override per chat.
  - `/append_system_prompt [text|reset]` — same for the appended system prompt.
- `opusplan` model alias surfaced everywhere: telegram bot, OpenAI `/openai/v1/models`, MCP tool docstring, docs.
- `tests/test_cron_telegram.sh` — unit + integration tests for the cron/telegram bridge: round-trip message tracking, prune to 200 entries, no-`--continue` on cron replies, `CRON_SYSTEM_HINT` content, combined-entrypoint smoke test.
- `run-e2e-cron-telegram.sh` — end-to-end script (sources `tests/.env` for credentials) for the cron+telegram reply-context flow.

### Changed
- `get_chat_config()` merges in-memory + on-disk overrides on top of YAML defaults.
- `_apply_choice` / `_send_choice_keyboard` / `_BUTTON_HANDLERS` shared plumbing for keyboard-driven overrides.

### Security
- `run-e2e-cron-telegram.sh` now sources `tests/.env` instead of carrying hardcoded OAuth/bot tokens. (A previously-committed token in `v1.10.0`'s `run-test.sh` was auto-revoked by Anthropic's secret scanning; new token issued and stored only in gitignored `tests/.env`.)

## [v1.10.0] — 2026-04-29

### Added
- **Combined cron + telegram mode**: when both `CLAUDEBOX_MODE_CRON=1` and `CLAUDEBOX_MODE_TELEGRAM=1` are set, the entrypoint runs the cron scheduler in the background and the telegram bot in the foreground (trap kills cron when the bot exits).
- Cron yaml supports `telegram_chat_id` (root-level default + per-job override) — finished jobs post their result to Telegram.
- **Cron-reply context injection**: when a user replies to a cron notification in Telegram, the bot looks up the original job (name, fired_at, instruction, result) in `~/.claude/cron/telegram_messages.json` and prepends it to the prompt. Cron replies always run in a fresh session (no `--continue`); regular messages keep `--continue`.
- Chat-wide cron awareness: the most recent 10 cron runs are injected into every prompt's `--append-system-prompt` so Claude can answer questions about them without an explicit reply.
- `telegram_utils.py` shared module (`BOT_TOKEN`, `make_bot()`, `send_long()`); `send_long()` now returns the list of sent `Message` objects so the caller can capture `message_id`.
- `wrapper.sh` gained a named `_cron` container with start/stop/restart parity to `_prog`, plus an auth file.

## [v1.9.0] — 2026-04-29

### Added
- Cron jobs support `system_prompt` / `append_system_prompt` (root-level + per-job override).
- Template variables expanded at fire time: `{system_datetime}`, `{job_name}`.

## [v1.8.0] — 2026-04-29

### Added
- `claudebox mcp ...` wrapper passthrough (`list`, `add`, `remove`, …) so MCP server management works the same as bare `claude mcp`.
- Documentation covering MCP server scopes (project `.mcp.json`, user, local) with CLI examples.

## [v1.7.0] — 2026-04-29

### Added
- **Cron mode** (`CLAUDEBOX_MODE_CRON=1`): yaml-scheduled Claude jobs with sub-minute resolution, per-job history under `~/.claude/cron/history/<workspace-slug>/<ts>-<job>/`, overlap protection, and foreground logging.

### Changed
- Environment variable namespace renamed `CLAUDE_*` → `CLAUDEBOX_*`. Legacy `CLAUDE_*` names are still accepted as fallbacks for backwards compatibility.

## [v1.6.0] — 2026-04-29

### Added
- Proper standalone installer (`install.sh`) that drops in a working setup with one command.

## [v1.5.0] — 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- Misc release-blocking bugs.

## [v1.4.1] — 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- Installer script regressions; bumped pinned Claude CLI version.

## [v1.4.0] — 2026-04-16

### Changed
- Base image upgraded to **Ubuntu 24.04** (CVE reduction).
- Adopted DEB822 apt sources; dropped `apt-transport-https` (no longer needed).
- `pip3 --break-system-packages --ignore-installed` to work around PEP 668 + PyJWT conflict.
- `userdel ubuntu` before `useradd claude` to free UID 1000.
- `exa` → `eza` (exa is unmaintained); `mysql-client` → `default-mysql-client`.
- Dropped `python3-venv`.

## [v1.3.0] — 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Async run mode** in API: `POST /run` with `async: true`, `GET /run/result` for polling. Run IDs included on every response. Read-once result cache with 6-hour TTL. Cancel by `runId`. `/status` now lists active runs.

### Changed
- All API responses include `workspace`.
- Switched build apt mirror to Cloudflare for faster Docker builds.
- README updated with full response schemas.

### Fixed
- `asyncio.Lock` around run state to eliminate races.

## [v1.2.0] — 2026-04-11

### Security
- Telegram **path traversal** fix on file operations.
- Auth file mode hardened to `chmod 600`.
- Entrypoint **command-injection** fix via `printf %q` quoting.
- `jq` failure protection.
- Port number validation.
- Install script fail-safe.

### Changed
- `/status` response normalized to camelCase.
- Test isolation via `mktemp`.

## [v1.1.0] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- `make test` target.
- `.dockerignore` (faster, smaller build context).
- Test for entrypoint always-skills wiring.

### Changed
- Tests refactored to a table-driven layout with workspace-relative test dirs.
- README revamp.

## [v1.0.0] — 2026-04-11

### BREAKING
Project renamed from `docker-claude-code` → **`claudebox`**:
- Docker image: `psyb0t/docker-claude-code` → `psyb0t/claudebox`.
- Binary: `claude-code` → `claudebox`.
- SSH dir: `~/.ssh/claude-code` → `~/.ssh/claudebox`.
- GitHub repo: `psyb0t/docker-claudebox`.

## [v0.39.0] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Always-skills**: scan `~/.claude/.always-skills` for `SKILL.md` files and inject them (with file-path prefix) into every Claude invocation across interactive, programmatic, API, and OpenAI modes.

## [v0.38.0] — 2026-04-10

### Added
- Structured JSON logging (`ts`, `level`, `logger`, `func`, `line`, `file`, `msg`) across auth, `/run`, OpenAI, MCP, and image handling. `DEBUG=1` enables debug level.

## [v0.37.0] — 2026-04-10

### Added
- **OpenAI multimodal**: base64 + URL images saved to the workspace and forwarded to Claude.
- Real usage-token reporting on OpenAI responses.
- Multi-turn via conversation JSON file.
- `X-Claude-Append-System-Prompt` request header.

### Changed
- Extra/unknown OpenAI fields silently ignored.

## [v0.36.0] — 2026-04-10

### Changed
- All 24 tests in `ALL_TESTS`; every assertion now checks the response body, not just status codes.

## [v0.35.0] — 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- `streamable_http_app` for MCP.
- MCP lifespan registered via FastAPI.
- `stream-json` assistant-event parsing.
- `--continue` flag logic.
- MCP tests with proper session init.

## [v0.34.0] — 2026-04-10

### Changed
- OpenAI `/v1/models` returns bare aliases (`haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus`).
- Provider prefix (`openai/`, `claudebox/`) stripped from inbound model names.
- Tests use `$TEST_MODEL` instead of hardcoded values.

## [v0.33.0] — 2026-04-10

### Added
- **OpenAI-compatible adapter** at `/openai/v1` (streaming, custom headers, `reasoning_effort`).
- **MCP server** at `/mcp` exposing `claude_run`, file operations, and auth tools.
- Shared `_run_claude_text` helper.

## [v0.32.0] — 2026-04-07

### Changed
- camelCase response normalization across the board: `jsonpipe.py` normalizes `json` / `stream-json` / `json-verbose`, wrapper pipes all formats. Tests assert recursively against snake_case.

## [v0.31.0] — 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- `asyncio.StreamReader` 64KB-line crash in API.
- Truncate `json-verbose` tool results > 2K with sha256 hash.

## [v0.30.0 – v0.29.0] — 2026-04-07

### Added
- `outputFormat: json-verbose` — assembles `stream-json` into a single JSON document with a `turns` array showing all tool calls.

## [v0.28.0] — 2026-04-03

### Added
- `clear-session` wrapper command.

### Fixed

- `CLAUDE_ENV_*` passthrough.
- `CLAUDE_INSTALL_DIR`, `CLAUDE_SSH_DIR`, `DEBUG` env-var docs.

### Removed
